I can really use some help with a problem i am having with Cash App and documentation of the Bitcoin i owned, sold and transferred to my bank account. I am currently in Escrow for the purchase of my first home (woohoo!) and need to show an official statement or document of the Bitcoin and when and where it was withdrawn and sent to. I have been sending emails back and forth to their support and its lead me nowhere. 

Can someone help me understand how to find a document that shows how much bitcoin was owned, when it was sold and how it was transferred to my bank account? I have the Tax documents but they will not work because it only has info on last year and not 2021. I also have the Cash App Report but it also will not work as it does not have any of my personal information on it

I have been impatiently waiting for it to get a foothold at $60k. It has just seemed to hover and tantalize the 60k mark. I think (again beginner) that once it does that it will shoot up to the mid 60's with relative ease. It seems to me to be an emotional barrier to cross. I also wonder if the fact that big money and firms are buying into the exchange so that also is stabilizing the price somewhat. There was not a sticking point before 40k and 50k so I wonder why at 60? When it was approaching 10k was there a speedbump like this? It does not affect my decisions or strategy but I am just curious and wonder if any of you think it will climb quickly after getting through the $60k marker? Thank you in advance and I look forward to learning from you guys through this ya'll's responses to this post.

1617657911,Bitcoin,"Tried to post on ""BitcoinBegginers"", but something won't let meSo, some years ago I bought some bucks on BTC and stored it on Jaxx Liberty, but now I would like to take it back.

The thing is that fees charged on Jaxx are too high for the amount I have there (even if I set them to ""lower""). According to my search, I can export my private keys on Jaxx and import it on some other wallet that would allow me to pay less to transfer the money to my exchange. All I would have to pay are the transaction fees from wallet 2 to the exchange.

And yes, I know it would take longer, but I'm willing to wait.

I've tried to import it to B[itcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com/)'s wallet, but the amount won't appear there. I've sign up on Coinbase, but haven't found any way to import the wallet. Same goes for eToro.

So what I am doing wrong? What do I need to do to take money from Jaxx and put it on some other wallet, in order to pay lower transaction fees?"

Without doing that myself, I would've never started buying Bitcoin 10 years ago I heard everyone saying $10k was impossible in 2017 too. Then Bitcoin shut everyone up by running up to $20k. We should stop bitching about these analyses and take them into consideration by trying to run the numbers ourselves to verify or disprove their logic. That's how I got started 10 years ago. I Heard Bitcoin could go to $1 million then, and instead of bitching about how ridiculous the prediction was, I read the articles making the statement, ran the numbers behind their logic myself, and verified the numbers; then I realized $1 million was extremely conservative when I ran the numbers myself, and that the real stabilization number where Bitcoin's growth would slow and resemble the current tech stock market would be something more like 10 million+. And even then that's nowhere near where the math stops, that's just where it stabilizes to the point where then countries can jump in without being able to spike, tank, or drain the market. That's when Bitcoin's liquidity becomes equivalent to the ocean in terms of size and strength"

The chances of a young healthy adult like myself to become permanently disabled in the next 10 years is probably less than 0.1%

1617753791,Bitcoin,"storage diversification...I'm pretty new to this but would welcome some input. my learning curve is steep but it's fun and I'm grateful to be in this world, however late to the party I might be.

right now I'm considering Nexo vs. Celsius vs. BlockFi for storage. seems like using all three to manage risk would be a good move but I'd love some feedback. my portfolio is around %50/35/15 alt.

also, since I'm basically in the Saylor camp of ""the dollar is not something I want to hold"", I'm wondering if it makes more sense to convert most of my cash (not emergency funds) into stable coins and if so, which ones. truth told, I'm not even really sure I understand stable coins yet. I just know that since I've moved into crypto, I feel infinitely more inspired and optimistic about my assets. And I can't put a price tag on that.

anyways... go easy on me, I'm new and realize I might sound silly. I do a lot of research on my own but still... we all learn sometime and this site seems like a great place to get a variety of opinions.

hope your life is going well.

peace and thank you."

1617750276,Bitcoin,"Sacramento Kings To Offer Bitcoin Salary Option To PlayersSacramento Becomes First NBA Team To Offer Bitcoin Salaries

US professional basketball team Sacramento Kings is offering its staff and players the option of earning in Bitcoin. This was disclosed by the team’s Chairman, CEO, and Governor Vivek Ranadivé on popular social networking app, Clubhouse. 

The news first broke out on Twitter after a Clubhouse audience member, Neil Jacobs, tweeted what the Sacramento Kings owner said.

“I’m going to announce in the next few days that I’m going to offer everyone in the Kings organization, they can get paid as much of their salary in bitcoin as they want, including the players,” said Ranadivé, according to Jacobs.

The news has generated many opinions from crypto critics and enthusiasts. Most say that this move would strengthen the California NBA team’s long-standing claim to be one of the most pro-crypto teams in professional sports.

This is not the first time the sports team has innovated using blockchain tech. Sacramento Kings announced back in 2014 that they were open to receiving payments in Bitcoin for their team merchandise in partnership with payment processor BitPay.

It also started mining cryptocurrency in 2018 by setting up a program called MiningForGood that donates the funds to charity. 

In 2019, Sacramento Kings went on to launch rewards tokens for fans. The token was called The Kings Token, and it was done in partnership with blockchain-based event ticketing platform Blockparty."

I like to think that his/her/their many stacks of satoshis mined way back in the earliest days of Bitcoin are not forever stuck never to move again.  Rather, it only appears that way for now.  Maybe one day, predetermined by him/her/them, when Bitcoin has become the reserve currency of the world or recognized global store of value (choose whatever term you see fit), that at the exact right moment in time, those earliest day satoshis find their way out of seemingly frozen wallets and into those hodling just a little bit of BTC.  Whether those satoshis rain down all at once into those many wallets of the small hodlers, or they creep out over time, either way that would be one way to right the ship somewhat from the heavy weight of all this institutional money now pouring in from the Wall Street crowd and corporations, all of whom have bags of money to gobble up every last Bitcoin.  Not because they were true believers, but because they understood (almost) too late their money and wealth was melting away if they did not act quickly.

Let's say someone has 10 BTC from various transactions (Tx) which were 1 BTC, 2 BTC, 3 BTC, and 4 BTC respectively, and they want to send someone else 5.5 BTC.

It is my understanding that you cannot simply verify that 5.5 &lt; 10 and thus verify the Tx to be pushed into a block which will be mined.

Rather, you must find all of the previous unspent TX amounts that they received as inputs (someone else sent or change for sending too much) and select a combination of these such that their sum is greater than or equal to what they would like to send. From my example, that would be 2 BTC + 4 BTC (or 1 + 2 + 3 or even 3 + 4) - I assume that the system in place chooses the last number of unspent amounts that are closest to this amount, or does the account owner choose this?

If the amount of these unspent TX amounts equals the sum you want to send - great you get no change in return. Otherwise, you get change as a new unspent TX output. So in my example using 2+4 would give you a change of 0.5BTC, so now you have 0.5 BTC, 1 BTC, 3 BTC as UTXOs. Trying to spend more than 4.5 BTC would now cause the transaction to not be verified as all other nodes would see that you only have 4.5 BTC from your UTXO history.

Is my thinking correct? If so, I have a few questions I would love to get a better understanding on since I am currently working on a cryptocurrency project:

1. Does this approach come from the fact that BTC does not have denominations
2. Why is a UTXO system used rather than a Account Balance one?
3. Does every wallet have a UTXO history? What stops a user from editing it? Or does each node navigate the blockchain history searching for public key matching the transaction to find this history.
4. Double spending is prevented since only one set of transactions is approved at a time. Thus, if a user sends 5.5 BTC twice, and the first transaction is verified and added to the blockchain, the second transaction will fail since they do not have sufficient UTXOs now (only 4.5BTC)? If they had 20 BTC to start, then both will pass?
5. Miner need to first verify all transactions by their corresponding public key and above method of checking UTXO history for each transaction in a block. Then they can use a ""nonce"" to find a hash for this block that starts with a few zeros using their computational power. Once they do these steps, assuming they are lucky enough to be first, they get a portion of the ""change"" and some newly generated fraction of a bitcoin and the block they mined gets pushed onto the longest chain?

I have the big picture but just need a push in the right direction as I cannot see how all of these variables get put together to make the overall system secure.

Thank you for your time and advice."

I think someone said that the government won't back it because, dollars come from gold.. not from digital data..

so the US Dollar won't support it.

and if noone else does.. (other countries, etc.) it's basically... toilet paper, no?

What true monetary value does bitcoin, or any other digital currency really have??

I have been reading and it says that as Bitcoin goes down in price, investors switch interest to alt coins and therefore alt coins like Ethereum rises. I dont hold Bitcoin but I have alt coins and every time I see Bitcoin go down it includes alt coins. When I see this I get worried coz I am afraid I may lose the value of the coins I have. 

So when Bitcoin goes down, other coins will go down in price as well then Bitcoin will become stagnant in price after that alt coins will skyrocket and rise? is that how alt season works?

1617835009,Bitcoin,"People say you take a risk when investing in Bitcoin. I see it different.Usually, when you bring up cryptocurrency to someone in a conversation they will say something like “Oh, but isn’t that a very risky investment?”. Well yes, but actually no.
Sure you can lose money because of the volatility, but thats not my point. 

A year ago I started investing in cryptocurrency and my perspective on the risks involved have changed a lot since time has passed. We all know the feeling of FOMO, the risk of missing out on the gains you could’ve made on an investment. The risk of losing a future you could’ve had, an improvement of life. The fear of having the feeling of ‘Oh well, if only I would’ve...’ Well. I’m not willing to take that risk.

The point I’m trying to make is, its a risk NOT to invest in crypto because you risk missing out the best life you can live. Its an escape ticket to a better future and not accepting it would be a risk of losing that what can be. Sometimes you gotta do something risky to play it safe, you know?"

We have just released support for bitcoin deposits &amp; withdrawals using Liquid at [Betplay.io](https://Betplay.io). We want to offer our users faster &amp; cheaper payment options and seeing how well Bitcoin Lightning is working we think this can be a great complement to that for users who prefer using Liquid instead.

Payments have been about 1 minute during testing and fees are low. For example, a transfer of 20 uBTC incurred a total fee of 0.2 uBTC which we think is quite good considering the onchain fees right now.

We see the highest challenge around Liquid at the moment to be adoption as it is not really widely used at the moment. Actually getting L-BTC funds is also not super easy, we are using [Sideshift](https://sideshift.ai/btc/liquid) to fund our wallets which is okay but was not trivial to find. 

However, using the [Blockstream Green wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/) has been a nice experience overall and we will have as an option and see if we get any traction on it. Hopefully we will be able to report back on some adoption statistics later this year if anyone is interested.

Fomero  is the leading double-spend tool for blockchain-related projects. It  allows you to test your application for double-spending.

What is double-spend?

Double-spend  consists in spending the same coins twice. This tool emits two  different transactions using the same coins. One of the transactions  goes to your target's wallet, whereas the second transaction goes back  to you. Once the second transaction gets confirmed, the first one is  cancelled.

Why should I care?

An  application vulnerable to double-spending allows anyone using this tool  to buy products and services with bitcoin, for free. From digital goods  to physical products.

Can I get confirmations before double-spending a transaction?

No.  This would only be possible through a 51% attack, where you would mine  more blocks faster than all the network miners, in order to create and  broadcast a longer blockchain (that would get accepted by the network).  This would be pretty expensive, however.

How can Fomero help me in protecting my website?

(1) I'm not tech savvy, so if you respond, please keep in mind.  
(2) I serendipitously entered the world of crypto (Coinbase Pro &amp; Binance) last Sept (lucky me), and all's looking good until I start reading articles that say DO NOT LEAVE YOUR CRYPTO IN EXCHANGES...you don't really own your crypto if you do...hackers and all that obnoxious shit  
(3) So I start fumbling around and use [bitaddress.org](https://bitaddress.org) to create public addy/private key  
(4) Now I'm too nervous to transfer lots of $ (lest it disappear into the ether), so I stumble through and successfully transfer .02 BTC to my public address (which probably cost me stupid fees, but whatevs)  
(5) Then I'm like ""now that this BTC isn't in an exchange anymore (and I guess it's just out there on the blockchain somewhere) where do I go to view it?  
(6) And now I'm also thinking ""HTF am I gonna get it back into an exchange when it's time to cash out 10 years from now and I want to retire to Costa Rica?""  I look on Binance and Coinbase Pro and they give me addresses where I can send it to so that it goes back into the exchange, but where do I go to tell the blockchain to send my .02 BTC to these address that the exchanges are giving me?

Seriously, I've been reading and watching videos for 8 hours trying to figure this out, so please be kind in your comments.  Why oh why did I major in English?

1617921004,Bitcoin,"Some pretty amazing developments are happening in bitcoin technology...While we see a lot of Bitcoin news in mainstream media, one thing that often gets overlooked is the developments made to improve the technology. 

Bitcoin technology saw major developments and upgrades in the past year \[2020\] and has some promising updates coming in 2021. 

# [2020]

**Lightning Network:**

One of the key developments within the Lightning Network in 2020 has been Watchtowers, which makes the protocol more secure.

One of Lightning Networks' drawbacks is that it made it possible for users to cheat and claim more funds than actually allocated to them. The partner user can stop this from happening but it requires continued monitoring of the bitcoin blockchain.

To avoid this, [Watchtower](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/watchtowers/) was implemented which allows channel monitoring to be outsourced to impartial observers.

**Taproot:**

Taproot is supposed to be a major upgrade to the bitcoin protocol which would bring about huge improvements to the bitcoin’s scalability, fungibility, &amp; privacy.

Taproot would essentially make smart contracts look like regular bitcoin transactions, thanks to [Schnorr signature](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-power-of-schnorr-the-signature-algorithm-to-increase-bitcoin-s-scale-and-privacy-1460642496), 

Using this will greatly reduce the transaction size giving room for more transactions on the block and increase privacy.

Taproots activation has been a topic of discussion for the past couple of months and various activation and consensus mechanisms are being tested.

**PayJoin and CoinSwap:**

PayJoin and CoinSwap are two protocols that were designed to increase the privacy of bitcoin transactions.

Currently, bitcoin transactions are not exactly private they are pseudo-anonymous, meaning with a little tracking they can be traced back to the user.

With [PayJoin, or Pay to EndPoint \[P2EP\]](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payjoin/), the user sends funds to themselves while also receiving funds from the actual receiver. This tricks anyone tracking the funds to think that all the funds belong to the same person when in fact that is not the case. 

**Vaults**

[Bitcoin Vaults](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/vaults/) are a type of smart contract that will require bitcoin transactions several confirmations and a time delay to actually be spent.

This will time for the potential victim to reverse the transaction and get back the stolen bitcoins.

**Smart Contracts - DLC**

This update, designed for smart contracts, will bring about a change in how they operate when they rely on external data \[data that does not live on the blockchain\]. 

**MINSC**

 A Miniscript-based scripting language for Bitcoin contracts, MINSC would greatly simplify the creation of bitcoin transactions. 

# [2021]

**Bech32m**

It is expected that Bech32m will support Taproot and all future segwit based script updates. 

**Private Key** 

This [feature](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21201) will add an update to the bitcoin wallets through which users will not be able to send transaction(s) from their wallet if the private key is disabled. 

**Multiple fee rate request**

This [update](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083) would bring about a change to the fee rate selection process that happens during the coin selection. It would essentially avoid coin selection from failing.

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone’s piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If “Alice gives bob 1 bitcoin” is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction “Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin” must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a “private key”.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let’s say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone’s ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with “proof of work” which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called “mining”. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

The seller on Amazon is SatoshiLabs and both the hardwallet listing and the seller both have several hundred positive reviews that appear legit.

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary. The packaged had the vacuum plastic seal, the Trezor itself had the tamper sticker and appeared to be untampered with, and when I first set up the Trezor it didn't have any firmware downloaded which means it had never been used.

Should I be worried? I feel I'm being too cautious but I do have a decent amount stored there and plan to only add more in the future. 

Are the official sellers listed on Trezor's website? I haven't been able to find a page with that information.

I know I failed severely, but I just did not realize that an atm company would outright scam like that.  I have used such atms several times before, and when I started doing so I checked everything, the exchange rate, etc.  This time I just trusted my previous experience, but it was a different machine.  Crazy, I know, but humans are fallible, and there is no excuse for this kind of thing.  It is outright fraud.  They imply they are selling you bitcoin like a currency, and there is no mention of massive fees off the top.  

They charged me an exchange rate of 98,754.55 cad/btc  when the going rate is about 73,200.  35% increase.

All kinds of warnings about not submitting to CRA scams, but the whole thing is a scam from the beginning.

It's the machine at the hasty market at 1896 prince of wales drive, ottawa, ontario.

I always feel so terrible, suffer from anxiety and depression which contributes to making mistakes like this, but now I lost all this money in an instant I feel even worse.  I was trying to feel better by accomplishing something, and this is what happens.  I fucked up, I was weak, but that does not make it excusable.

I worked at 15 bucks an hour shovelling snow all winter, and they just take my money just like that.

I complained to the owner, asking them to put a sign up next to the machine, at the very least.  Scam warning, same as for the CRA scams.  I think it is the least that could be done.

I called the company, they refused to give my any kind of apology or anything.

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone’s piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If “Alice gives bob 1 bitcoin” is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction “Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin” must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a “private key”.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let’s say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone’s ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with “proof of work” which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called “mining”. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

The seller on Amazon is SatoshiLabs and both the hardwallet listing and the seller both have several hundred positive reviews that appear legit.

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary. The packaged had the vacuum plastic seal, the Trezor itself had the tamper sticker and appeared to be untampered with, and when I first set up the Trezor it didn't have any firmware downloaded which means it had never been used.

Should I be worried? I feel I'm being too cautious but I do have a decent amount stored there and plan to only add more in the future. 

Are the official sellers listed on Trezor's website? I haven't been able to find a page with that information.

I know I failed severely, but I just did not realize that an atm company would outright scam like that.  I have used such atms several times before, and when I started doing so I checked everything, the exchange rate, etc.  This time I just trusted my previous experience, but it was a different machine.  Crazy, I know, but humans are fallible, and there is no excuse for this kind of thing.  It is outright fraud.  They imply they are selling you bitcoin like a currency, and there is no mention of massive fees off the top.  

They charged me an exchange rate of 98,754.55 cad/btc  when the going rate is about 73,200.  35% increase.

All kinds of warnings about not submitting to CRA scams, but the whole thing is a scam from the beginning.

It's the machine at the hasty market at 1896 prince of wales drive, ottawa, ontario.

I always feel so terrible, suffer from anxiety and depression which contributes to making mistakes like this, but now I lost all this money in an instant I feel even worse.  I was trying to feel better by accomplishing something, and this is what happens.  I fucked up, I was weak, but that does not make it excusable.

I worked at 15 bucks an hour shovelling snow all winter, and they just take my money just like that.

I complained to the owner, asking them to put a sign up next to the machine, at the very least.  Scam warning, same as for the CRA scams.  I think it is the least that could be done.

I called the company, they refused to give my any kind of apology or anything.

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone’s piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If “Alice gives bob 1 bitcoin” is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction “Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin” must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a “private key”.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let’s say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone’s ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with “proof of work” which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called “mining”. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

The seller on Amazon is SatoshiLabs and both the hardwallet listing and the seller both have several hundred positive reviews that appear legit.

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary. The packaged had the vacuum plastic seal, the Trezor itself had the tamper sticker and appeared to be untampered with, and when I first set up the Trezor it didn't have any firmware downloaded which means it had never been used.

Should I be worried? I feel I'm being too cautious but I do have a decent amount stored there and plan to only add more in the future. 

Are the official sellers listed on Trezor's website? I haven't been able to find a page with that information.

1617995657,Bitcoin,"thebitcoinmachine.com machine exchange rates inflated by 35 %I just got scammed for $255.  I know I failed severely, but I just did not realize that an atm company would outright scam like that.  I have used such atms several times before, and when I started doing so I checked everything, the exchange rate, etc.  This time I just trusted my previous experience, but it was a different machine.  Crazy, I know, but humans are fallible, and there is no excuse for this kind of thing.  It is outright fraud.  They imply they are selling you bitcoin like a currency, and there is no mention of massive fees off the top.  

They charged me an exchange rate of 98,754.55 cad/btc  when the going rate is about 73,200.  35% increase.

All kinds of warnings about not submitting to CRA scams, but the whole thing is a scam from the beginning.

It's the machine at the hasty market at 1896 prince of wales drive, ottawa, ontario.

I always feel so terrible, suffer from anxiety and depression which contributes to making mistakes like this, but now I lost all this money in an instant I feel even worse.  I was trying to feel better by accomplishing something, and this is what happens.  I fucked up, I was weak, but that does not make it excusable.

I worked at 15 bucks an hour shovelling snow all winter, and they just take my money just like that.

I complained to the owner, asking them to put a sign up next to the machine, at the very least.  Scam warning, same as for the CRA scams.  I think it is the least that could be done.

I called the company, they refused to give my any kind of apology or anything.

Again, I know I fucked up, but that's the nature of fraud.  Preying on weakness."

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone’s piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If “Alice gives bob 1 bitcoin” is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction “Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin” must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a “private key”.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let’s say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone’s ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with “proof of work” which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called “mining”. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

1617996603,Bitcoin,"Purchased a Hardwallet on Amazon. Should I be worried?I tried ordering a Trezor hardwallet from the official Trezor website but after a few failed attempts due to issues with my payment not going through, I ended up purchasing one on Amazon.

The seller on Amazon is SatoshiLabs and both the hardwallet listing and the seller both have several hundred positive reviews that appear legit.

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary. The packaged had the vacuum plastic seal, the Trezor itself had the tamper sticker and appeared to be untampered with, and when I first set up the Trezor it didn't have any firmware downloaded which means it had never been used.

Should I be worried? I feel I'm being too cautious but I do have a decent amount stored there and plan to only add more in the future. 

Are the official sellers listed on Trezor's website? I haven't been able to find a page with that information.

1617995657,Bitcoin,"thebitcoinmachine.com machine exchange rates inflated by 35 %I just got scammed for $255.  I know I failed severely, but I just did not realize that an atm company would outright scam like that.  I have used such atms several times before, and when I started doing so I checked everything, the exchange rate, etc.  This time I just trusted my previous experience, but it was a different machine.  Crazy, I know, but humans are fallible, and there is no excuse for this kind of thing.  It is outright fraud.  They imply they are selling you bitcoin like a currency, and there is no mention of massive fees off the top.  

They charged me an exchange rate of 98,754.55 cad/btc  when the going rate is about 73,200.  35% increase.

All kinds of warnings about not submitting to CRA scams, but the whole thing is a scam from the beginning.

It's the machine at the hasty market at 1896 prince of wales drive, ottawa, ontario.

I always feel so terrible, suffer from anxiety and depression which contributes to making mistakes like this, but now I lost all this money in an instant I feel even worse.  I was trying to feel better by accomplishing something, and this is what happens.  I fucked up, I was weak, but that does not make it excusable.

I worked at 15 bucks an hour shovelling snow all winter, and they just take my money just like that.

I complained to the owner, asking them to put a sign up next to the machine, at the very least.  Scam warning, same as for the CRA scams.  I think it is the least that could be done.

I called the company, they refused to give my any kind of apology or anything.

Again, I know I fucked up, but that's the nature of fraud.  Preying on weakness."

\-----------------------------

What if I told you that Bitcoin is not money? Bitcoin is transactions.

Suppose that Alice, Bob, and Doge each possess 1 bitcoin. They have one piece of paper each, in which they have written that they have one bitcoin.

Alice wants to give Bob half a bitcoin. She writes this on her piece of paper and she tells bob and Doge, so they can update their own piece of paper with the transaction.

Now Bob writes in his piece of paper that he gives 1 bitcoin to Doge, and he tells Alice and Doge. 

Doge, who is the most generous, writes that he gives 2 bitcoins to Alice and he notifies the others.

Everyone’s piece of paper is now a ledger of transactions that looks the same, and it looks like this. 

If you calculate what this means you find that Bob has half a bitcoin, Doge has no bitcoins, and Alice has 2 and a half bitcoins.

Bitcoin works exactly like this. There is a digital shared record, a ledger, in which all the transactions are kept, and they determine the amount each participant has.

The ledger is kept by every participant independently. A participant is a computer in a network. Therefore there are many copies of the ledger.

But how do we determine if a transaction is real? If “Alice gives bob 1 bitcoin” is written on the ledger this should be a transaction created by Alice and not by Bob.

This problem is solved with signatures. The transaction “Alice gives Bob 1 bitcoin” must be followed by a unique signature that only Alice can write. In bitcoin, this is accomplished by something called a “private key”.

If Alice writes a new transaction and she wants to sign it, her private key and the transaction are given to a function that outputs a signature, and this signature is practically impossible to reproduce without the private key from which it is generated.

Private keys are also used to generate public keys, which must be sent to the other network participants for them to verify the validity of the new transaction. The public key, the signature, and the transaction are given to another function that checks that the signature has been generated by the private key associated with the public key and with the transaction given in input.

Public keys are also used to generate bitcoin addresses, which are used to represent sender and receiver in the transactions stored in the bitcoin ledger.

Programs that store private keys and public keys and sign transactions are called bitcoin wallets.

But there is another problem: how do the participants of the network update their own ledger with the incoming transactions? In what order are transactions updated and what if there is conflicting information? 

First, we need to know how the ledger is organized: the ledger is divided in blocks linked together and forming a chain of blocks (a blockchain!). Each block contains some transactions and a code. The code is generated using the content of the block and the content of all the previous blocks in the ledger. Generating the code is very hard and uses a lot of computational power.

Let’s say Alice and Bob broadcast their transactions because they want them added to everyone’s ledger. The participants of the network, after receiving the signed transactions, generate a new block and they try to find the code for it, in a highly computation-intensive process. The first participant who is able to find the code broadcasts the new block to the network. The block is then added to the ledger of every other participant. 

Generating the code validates the transactions in the new block with “proof of work” which means that computational power has been used.  The new block also contains a special transaction, which rewards those who found the code with new bitcoins created from scratch. Validating new blocks by using computational power to generate codes is called “mining”. 

If someone broadcasts a block with a transaction that conflicts with other transactions, that block will be stored alongside the others, forming another chain of blocks. After a while, the chain that becomes longer gets considered the valid one. In this way, the group of miners with the most computing power decide which transaction history is the valid one because they will be able to mine new blocks faster. Therefore, the transactions considered valid are the ones with the most proof of work. 

In order for a single entity to break this mechanism, it would need more computing power than all of the other miners put together. As the network grows it becomes more and more practically unfeasible."

The seller on Amazon is SatoshiLabs and both the hardwallet listing and the seller both have several hundred positive reviews that appear legit.

I've had a fair bit of Crypto stored on the hardwallet for 2 weeks now and nothing seems out of the ordinary. The packaged had the vacuum plastic seal, the Trezor itself had the tamper sticker and appeared to be untampered with, and when I first set up the Trezor it didn't have any firmware downloaded which means it had never been used.

Should I be worried? I feel I'm being too cautious but I do have a decent amount stored there and plan to only add more in the future. 

Are the official sellers listed on Trezor's website? I haven't been able to find a page with that information.

Also, don't bother sending me DMs. You will be blocked/ignored.

1617995657,Bitcoin,"thebitcoinmachine.com machine exchange rates inflated by 35 %I just got scammed for $255.  I know I failed severely, but I just did not realize that an atm company would outright scam like that.  I have used such atms several times before, and when I started doing so I checked everything, the exchange rate, etc.  This time I just trusted my previous experience, but it was a different machine.  Crazy, I know, but humans are fallible, and there is no excuse for this kind of thing.  It is outright fraud.  They imply they are selling you bitcoin like a currency, and there is no mention of massive fees off the top.  

They charged me an exchange rate of 98,754.55 cad/btc  when the going rate is about 73,200.  35% increase.

All kinds of warnings about not submitting to CRA scams, but the whole thing is a scam from the beginning.

It's the machine at the hasty market at 1896 prince of wales drive, ottawa, ontario.

I always feel so terrible, suffer from anxiety and depression which contributes to making mistakes like this, but now I lost all this money in an instant I feel even worse.  I was trying to feel better by accomplishing something, and this is what happens.  I fucked up, I was weak, but that does not make it excusable.

I worked at 15 bucks an hour shovelling snow all winter, and they just take my money just like that.

I complained to the owner, asking them to put a sign up next to the machine, at the very least.  Scam warning, same as for the CRA scams.  I think it is the least that could be done.

I called the company, they refused to give my any kind of apology or anything.

Again, I know I fucked up, but that's the nature of fraud.  Preying on weakness."

1618445809,Bitcoin,"No, Bitcoin is not a good investmentIf we want to understand the future of Bitcoin, we should look at its history, its pioneers so you can make a clear decision.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2013 from douban.com. Douban is a website for books, movies and music reviews and you can also form different groups. There you can meet different kinds of interesting people. We had a group called Primordial Evil and one was called Giant Goose. His real name is Xinyu Jiang, and he has a more famous name in Bitcoin industry - FriedCat. This name is less known today, but he was the first one used Bitcoin as IPO method to attract investment to make Bitcoin mining ASIC/machines as early as in 2012 in bitcointalk. In July, 2012, he founded his own company Bitfountain in Shenzhen. One of the early investor was Jihan Wu, owner of Bitmain. FriedCat was the second designed and manufactured Bitcoin mining machines based on the ASICs made by his own company. And in early 2013, FriedCat mining machine first mined Bitcoin and his computation power alone consisted of 42% of all Bitcoin network. 

I didn't have many conversations in Douban with FriedCat back then. He has a Douban post which I had very deep impression. I think it was called something like Consensus between Libertarians and Conservatives. This is because FriedCat himself was a libertarian and he had some friends who agreed Conservativism in Primordial Evil. He entered one of the best engineering college in China - University of Science and Technology of China at the age of 15 in 2001. It was said that his college entrance scores was 11th among the millions of Chinese high school students. In 2011, FriedCat went to study in Yale for his computer science doctor degree. He didn't finish his study. Because he touched Bitcoin then and was fascinated by the Libertarian philosophy so he decided to quit from Yale and begin his business in Bitcoin.

As you may have the question, why you never heard of FriedCat in today's world when the Bitcoin price rising higher and higher. Well, that's because he suddenly disappeared at the end of 2014. There's no real reports, from internet articles, here's what could have happened: As the expansion of his mining business, FriedCat was trying to find the right places for mining. Then there was someone called Lin told FriedCat that he had the right place with cheap electricity. Then FriedCat put 6000 mining machines into this place and then Lin modified the account and hijacked all those resources and FriedCat tried to go to argue and might be kidnapped and forced to transfer 19000 bitcoins. That was how FriedCat disappeared from Bitcoin stage at least for now. 

Among the Primordial Evil, the most successful one was Zhongjing (William) Liu. He was the greatest historian in our century. And we can see this from his own life experience. He used to be a medical examiner in public security department in Ürümqi, Xinjiang/East Turkistan. Then he realized the danger between Chinese and local Muslims so he left public security department and studied in Chengdu for history master degree, shortly after he left Ürümqi, there was massacres between Chinese and local Muslims. Then in 2012, he went to Wuhan, that's right, the city where the Virus came. And he got his history doctor degree and exiled to US in 2016. As you can see, if he had stayed in Ürümqi or Wuhan, what could happen. William Liu is now the President of Basuria exile government. He also translated and wrote many books including The History of England Hume and Macaulay versions. And his fans called his knowledge system Auntology. 

As one of fans of William Liu, if we use the Auntology view, we can easily explain why FriedCat failed and why will the bitcoin fails. Yes, from logical perspective, Bitcoin is a great concept. However, in the real world, the most important thing is blood. If you have your life, then you will have plentiful chances to make money. However, if you die, you don't have any chances for neither money for other achievements. Intellectuals tends to exaggerate their importance, but in real history, intellectuals are nothing. This world is ruled by warriors. And yes, sometimes, warriors are also intellectuals such as George Washington. But without force, any perfect ideas are useless. Take FriedCat himself as an example, if in normal country where good people have force, he can either use public or private forces to help him get back those 6000 Bitcoin mining machines. However, in China where the violence was controlled by Communists and gangsters. FriedCat was fortunately enough keep his life. It is said that the last post FriedCat shared in Douban was America: Imagine the World Without Her. Trust me, this was from his own life experience. 

So now let's look at the Bitcoin. It will fall. Because unlike US dollars, there's no force behind it to support this money. In free world, people who have gold usually also own weapons and ammos so they can prevent their gold from being taken. Besides, China has too many computation resources so they can commandeered all the bitcoin mining machines in China and forge the fake transactions so this money system won't be credible anymore."
1618445705,Bitcoin,"Country of BitcoinOk, this will probably sound like a crazy idea, and it probably is, I guess I just got excited about the thought: what if some of the Bitcoin billionairs that already emerged from this thing put their money together and used it to buy a small piece of a country, you know like a free state. Something really small, but with a city, maybe from some third world country. They could then establish the first country in the world that uses bitcoin as their official currency"

Utility protocols with unjustified price rises, taking cues from Bitcoin.

It makes sense for BTC too go to the moon but alts? They're pretty much like software startup companies with a Developer team releasing updates monthly/weekly and so on.

Shouldn't the valuation of Altcoin be limited to the products potential?

It seems the euphoria of Bitcoin is pushing money into alts for all the wrong reasons.

Let's face it, Dogecoin was not supposed to be 10 cents. All that money was supposed to enter BTC.

Look at XRP, valued over 75B whereas Ripple's valuation is slightly near 3B. Such large valuation gaps are testament to the crazy participants in Crypto markets.

""Corporations"" will want coins that they can track the origin, as to have 'Green' coins and not 'China Coins'.  Personally, I don't see it of that big of a threat... but when combined with threat#2..

Threat #2. Governments may try to force exchanges to lock assets if a coin was involved in 'criminal activity'.  We all see how exchanges are making you bend over backwords with KYC to get any money out.

We all know every bitcoin is traceable and coins are stolen everyday.  If you receive a coin in a Peer to peer fashion.. one of them may make it into your wallet... then when you go to cash it out, governments tracking the coins send a subpoena to the exchange and you're locked.

I'm not here to spread FUD, and I don't see this being a problem for the next year... but I am thinking ahead a few years when governments catch up... Governments can't stop Bitcoin - but they sure as hell can mess with the on/off ramps.

What's everyone's thoughts on this?"

1618440564,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin keeps hitting all time highs. Why you shouldn't care.The whole point of bitcoin is to provide a secure form of transactions that can't be manipulated as the government sees fit.  (See the trillions of dollars injected into the economy as an example).  Getting excited about the conversion rate to USD is going against the whole point.  Bitcoin isn't designed to make money (it just so happens to be one of the best performing investments in recent history).  We should instead focus on getting excited every time that bitcoin gains more recognition and use in daily life.  Tesla, microvision, etc. Are just the start.  The near future will likely see this amazing currency being used for even more common purchases than buying a car.  Why convert BC to useless fiat when in 5, 10, 15 years you will be able to use it to buy the same things (and likely with significant more appreciation in value over the USD).

1618434273,Bitcoin,"Buying Bitcoin with Business in USI'm curious if there is a legal way to buy bitcoin with my business using pre-tax income here in the US, basically trying to do the small scale version of what these larger corporations are doing by putting it on their books. 

For example, say I currently own a company (solo S-Corp) that generates $300k in profit. If I converted the business to a C-Corp, paid myself a $100k salary as an employee (what I need to live off of), then purchased $200k of bitcoin that was owned as an asset of the company. Would that basically prevent me from paying tax on the $200k profit until years later when I sell the bitcoin and distribute the money to myself? 

Have any small business owners found a legal way to invest in bitcoin in a tax-deferred way? I was looking into mining but the IRS actually says that you pay tax on the market value of a mined bitcoin so that loophole obviously won't work."

1618534497,Bitcoin,"A tragic bitcoin story.Hello, my name is Thomas. I’m 22 years old. I wanted to share this story to the world in hope to help others make the right decision when it comes to investing / trading. 

I got into bitcoin mid 2017 when a friend of mine briefly told me about it. Without any research, I threw $100 into it just for fun. Like most crypto newbies mid bull run, it blew my mind how quickly my wealth was growing, even with such a small amount of money. 

Fast forward to the 20K peak in Jan. 2018, I had invested ~$1,000 into bitcoin, nearly doubling my investment to $2,000 by the top of the cycle. Still with no to little research of what Bitcoin even was, I didn’t sell. Like most crypto newbies, I ended up underwater on my investment later on in that same year. 

After realizing my investment was losing value, I decided it was time for me to dig deep in figuring out what the hell bitcoin even was. Immediately I made Google, YouTube, and Twitter my best friends. It’s truly amazing how much information you can learn online for free. 

After days, weeks, and months of research, I found myself not only understanding the concept of bitcoin better, but weirdly falling in love with the idea of how this technology could change the entire world. I decided to keep investing. 

By 2019, I was a true bitcoiner. I put 95% of my wealth into this asset, not by influence of others, but by choice. I joined crypto Twitter (wild bunch of people let me tell you), bought some books, studied economics, and learned technical analysis. By 2020, I had known what my passion was and I was trying to incorporate how I could live working in the crypto industry. 

I had accumulated ~3 bitcoins by early 2020. It made me feel on top of the world for having the 3 whole bitcoins by making money bussing tables for 3 years straight. None of my friends or family knew the importance it meant to me because they didn’t fully understand the importance of bitcoin. 

March 2020 comes around, covid. I was laid off work, wasn’t too upset because of the unemployment coming in, and knowing I had my 3 bitcoin. I decided to start learning how to trade in my mean time. I figured, why not? I have the time. So, I started dabbling into leverage trading. Made $1,000, lost $1,000, made it back again. Wasn’t really losing or gaining much, just kind of messing around. 

I decided to put $5K in next, 2 days later, gone. I never felt so sick in my life. The feeling of having the most precious asset in my life taken from me was horrible. I thought “I had to make it back.”

...and that ended up being the worst decision of my life. By august 2020, I had lost all of my bitcoin. And I have missed out on the bull run I’ve been waiting for the last 3 years of my life. I hope some of you see this and stop adding more to your trades, reconsider leverage, and be safe with your money. I have not stopped studying bitcoin, &amp; I redoing the past 3 years of my life all over again. I love the crypto community and I want to congratulate all you strong hands out there."

What's amazing is although these stories often have no further proof they are usually fully embraced without further question and scrutiny which is so great to see.
Then they're rewarded with shit loads of karma and congratulations.. because they are totally true.... every single one of them 🙂

So I'm coming up for almost 40k karma and although this post is nothing to do with me getting over that, I thought I'd mention that I can not wait for that day..

Anyways so my story...

Well there were some cute fluffy kittens, left outside in a plastic bag... I found them.. and because I'm such a a great guy.. I was like ""hey who wants sheds loads of Bitcoin for looking after these kittens?""

Some girl was like ""me I'll do it!""

So I was like.. ""hey, thanks here's the kittens now let me transfer you some Sats!""

She was like.. ""thanks!""

Now she looks after about 50 cute fluffy kittens!

Sometimes she'll text me and I'll like send her Sats for food and stuff..

So I basically saved all the kittens lives... they were all so cute and fluffy..

I guess if the didn't have paws they'd probably give me some karma on Reddit.. because this is all totally true.. kittens were saved!

Now light me up! 😃🚀"

1618530599,Bitcoin,"""Try Lightning"" they said, ""it's simple and easy now!""I've firmly believed Lightning Network was an awful solution since I first heard about it in 2016.

Adding middlemen back to a decentralised network that aimed to cut out middlemen just seemed absurd.

On top of that, payment channels just seemed far too confusing. Bitcoin is simple. LN is a complex clusterfuck.

---

Still, I like to research things myself, and come to my own conclusions. 

I'd heard it was much better now, and it 'just works', so I decided to give it a try.

Would just like to point out that I have a degree in computer science and have a lot of experience with crypto.

---

I downloaded Phoenix wallet, as I'd heard it was good. 

Wanted to top up my wallet, and was hit with the first roadblock. Am I able to send BTC to this LN address, or do I have to click ""Show Bitcoin Address"". 

This is extremely unclear, and I'm sure a lot of people will try sending BTC to the LN address. Thankfully, I understand what L2 solutions are, and have enough experience that this was easy to overcome.

Okay, cool, I have 0.01 BTC in my LN Wallet.

Now I need to try sending it to someone. I asked 6 different friends (who are into crypto) to install Phoenix and give me their address. All of them refused. They wanted nothing to do with LN. Cool.

So I set out to download a 2nd wallet on my phone. This shouldn't be too hard, right?

I land on Eclair, after a little research. Install that, and all good, time to do a transaction! 

Receive &gt; Lightning... ""You must enable this feature in the settings first"".

**Enable receive over Lightning**. There it is! Oh wait, whats this...? *""If this feature is enabled, you need to make sure that your phone is doesn't stay without internet connectivity for more than two weeks straight""*. What?! Why? What if i go camping?! I'm not allowed to go camping anymore? What happens if I do stay out of range for 2 weeks?! Not going to tell me? Ok, surprises are fun I guess.

Whatever. Okay. I won't go camping.

Now I can recei..... ""Please open a Lightning channel to receive payments over Lightning.""

Alrighty then, surely this will be easy and clear! Just click that + to open a new channel!

Paste a node URL, Scan a node URL, Random node, Acinq node.

WHAT?! I mean, this was meant to be easy. I don't have a node URL or paste or scan. I guess I'll pick a random node.

THIS FEATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE YET. Lovely.

Great.... ACINQ node? Errrr, confusing as fuck. No thanks. Okay, fuck that. I'll try a different wallet....

I saw Bitcoin Lightning Wallet mentioned a few times. I'll try that.

Okkkay, so pretty immediately, it's trying to make me open payment channels again. I have no fucking idea. It's at least giving me a list of peers to choose from. ACINQ is one of them. I suppose that's what ACINQ was on Eclair, a peer. Thanks for telling me that Eclair.

Okay, so I support I'll pick ACINQ, as it was on both apps, must be a good one right?!

Alrighty.... I can't open a channel because my wallet is empty. Cool. Cool cool cool.

It looked like Phoenix could receive on LN without doing all this bullshit, surely there's another wallet that will allow the same ease of use...?

Blue wallet might work. Oh wait, that's custodial. NO THANK YOU. 

Wallet of Satoshi! Oh, custodial too?! Why the fuck are these custodial? 

Breez. Ok I'll download Breez. No rating on Google Play and in Early Access... lovely. I'll try it anyway.

Annnnnd.... it doesnt even seem to be able to receive over LN? What?! Invoice? I don't want to send an invoice. Just give me a fucking receive address.

Seriously fuck this. I just want to send a single god damn test transaction.

I'll try a custodial wallet, surely they'll be easier...

Wallet of Satoshi.

Cool, it worked. Sent 10,000sats in an instant. Absolutely tiny fees.

---

So now that's done. I can uninstall all this garbage.

My conclusion, obviously, is that Lightning is still a smoldering mess of feces.

Everything about this just added layers of confusion and complexity and headaches. There is no way this trash is being adopted any time soon.

Phoenix wallet seemed by far the best. However, I didn't see it mentioned once on any of the ""best lightning wallets"" lists I found.

To anyone without experience in IT/tech, i say, good fucking luck. Don't bother."

Trusts and companies are contractual protocols written by and enforced by lawyers, bitcoin is a contractual protocol written on the internet and enforced by nodes all over the world.

The human race doesn't need money to be gold or paper or banks, the human race needs money to be an immutable contractual protocol that is enforced in every corner of the world by anyone with a computer and accessible by anyone anywhere.

1)if i understand correctly, bitcoin holders can vote on changes to the blockchain. How and where do these votes take place, and how does change happen? Who does it?

2) in regards to this, how did bitcoin fork? I have a very vague knowledge of these scenarios. Did people just make a new crypto and call it bitcoin cash? Did bitcoin holders hold a vote and part of the bitcoin system now functions as bitcoin cash? How did the split happen and how did it affect people?

3)if bitcoin goes proof of stake (which i understand it won't for a long time) it seems like that will tank bitcoin farming companies. Which is fine, im just wondering if i understand that correctly. Are Blockchain companies are reliant on proof of work?"

My wife has a cozy 401k that’s doing well so we will have something to fall back on, but I can’t help but think that I’d make so much more if I closed both of my accounts and spent the 5k I’d likely pocket after taxes to btc and just let it sit for the 30 years until I retire and have much more.

I'm new to the crpytospace i entered at november at the beginning of the bullmarket. I always see people talking about a six figure bitcoin and how the bull market will continue 6-7 months. However when is see this king of growth in the altcoin space especially dogecoin i really wonder if the bull market isn't like 90% through? I mean i can see Bitcoin hitting 100K usd, because this would be the market cap of apple and i think this is quite realistic. However with alctoins pumping so hard they will come down extreme in the next week and newer investors will get burned big time and maybe panic sell even their BTC positions?

Maybe some experienced hodler can share his view on the current market situation and give some arguments for a bull market end in the next 1-2 months and some arguments in favor of a bull market until october or november.

* Other coins have disappeared due to hacking, lack of interest, technical deficiencies. Those still alive are only there for experimentation or very niche markets.
* Governments of the world have audited and authorized only these currencies for paying employees, buying goods or services, and other normal transactions.
* In consequence, fiscal rules apply to cryptocurrency transactions, like paying VAT or taxes on salaries.
* People can choose their country’s currency or one the authorized crypto when doing transactions, either with exchange’s payment cards or directly from their cold wallet device.

Many say this trade can capture 10-25% per annum.  

For those not familiar, the contango trade involves buying BTC today and shorting the futures contract which is surprisingly meaningfully higher (and unusual).  This is a risk-free trade where you are essentially buying BTC and then promising to sell it a higher price in the future."

1618707547,Bitcoin,"7 year old payment credited to my account - no recollection of itThrowaway cuz, damn, this is wack


With the huge influx with the dogecoin I went back and found a neglected dogecoin wallet from 2014. Okay, that's awesome. I also remembered that I was only able to buy doge through buying Bitcoin and then converting it to Doge on an exchange. So far so good.

Because of this I search high and low and eventually find my Bitcoin wallet. Again, I was doing this stuff for shits and giggles, no exchanges over more than 50 US dollars. I was living paycheck to paycheck. I'm currently in the process of syncing my btc wallet from 84+ months past. I saw the expected purchases that I remember, but, then there is an 18btc payment credited to my account. I never messed with more than like 0.02btc. much less 9000 usd, at 2014 prices. 

My wallet is slow af to sync. An hour later I'm past syncing to the point where I messed with anything crypto... But not finished syncing. Is it a thing for crazy phantom things to pop up while syncing? It took place in the exact hour I was tinkering with things on the exchange. The only logical answer is I did something to receive the equivalent to 9000 usd or purchased it, which 100% poor kid did not do. Ooor I'm looking at gobbilygook and misreading things counting chickens on an incomplete sync. 

71 months behind...  Gah!"

1618703566,Bitcoin,"My BTC StoryEveryone seems to be telling Crypto stories at the moment so I thought I'd give it a go. I'd been thinking of buying BTC since 2017 but life got in the way, rent, children etc. Fast forward to March 2020 and the pandemic, I now proudly own 2 whole BTC! 

I am from a poor background by the way and maxed out a credit card borrowed from relatives to initially buy, I grew up in debt and have lived my entire adult life in debt, so far. 

I then decided to research the whole eco-system to work out how best to protect and maximise my investment, I had become really exited with my investment and 100% believe(d) it would save mine and my children's life, literally.

I initially came across some invaluable advice online, I did the usual, used a little profit to invest in a H Wallet, put a small % of coin into an interest account, created a small portfolio of reputable alt coins and buckled up for a long Hodl!!

Then I got bored waiting and rather than sell my beloved BTC I decided to try to earn more fast. Like I said before, money is tight and bills started piling up. 

I started watching trading videos, specifically videos from the ByBit mafia, BitBoy, MM Crypto, That Martini Guy and The Moon, that was the beginning of the end for mr. I found myself believing their daily updates and using more and more leverage to chase losses after a small initial win.

Long story short, I am now down to 0.013  BTC  ($650) and a small bag of ALTs which I now have to sell to pay off some of the Credit Card bill, at one point my portfolio was worth more than $100,000

I have fallen into depression, I cant get the thought of knowing that I had changed my life for good only to toss it away through my own actions. Worse still, at my age its almost a forgone conclusion that I will never see money like that again in my life. Greed is definitely a killer. 

This is not a pity post, This is a warning to everyone out there, DO NOT trade BTC, its too precious to lose, HODL, don't be an idiot like me and hand it to Billionaire vultures. 

Also, F\*\*k all of these YouTubers,  do no listen to them. The have fake accounts supplied by ByBit where they are trading with fake funds, they earn all of their money from referrals, scan their trading screens and you will see discrepancies. 

Just hours earlier toady The Moon (AKA Rat Boy) posted a video saying he thinks BTC may drop to 40k imminently, wtf?!! Talk about scaremongering, newbies like myself believe that sh\*t.  He also ended the video by saying BTC could also go up tonight but kinda skipped past that bit!! 

Also MM Crypto, 2 days ago he's shouting that BTC will go to 70k and then 100k rapidly. Todays video? ""This is very dangerous for Bitcoin"". !!!  I stopped listening to them weeks ago but YouTube seems to think that I want to see them on my feed still. 

My theory, ByBit instruct their ambassadors on what to say and at what time in order to cause volatility and create trading fee revenue, usually on the weekend.

If this was not the case, why would they plaster all of their trades all over the internet for everyone including the Tax man to see? Unless its fake money on their trading screens. These guys boast that they are Deca Millionaires but stream 2-3 times everyday begging for likes and subscriptions?!! 

More fool me, but they all need to be stopped. 

Anyway, I know all of the above is my fault and no one else's but if I can stop at least one other person from falling prey to these vultures then my loss would feel a little less painful."

I am new to mining. I have done some research and wanted to confirm if this is correct.

I have the following:

1. A NiceHash account
2. A CoinBase account
3. A BitPay account

My goal is to purchase some items from Newegg. Now Newegg accepts BitPay.

So,

1. I am looking to use coinbase as my primary account. Because it was very user friendly, has a website which I can use on my browser (unlike BitPay which makes you use the App, browser has limited functionality I saw).
2. I am mining on NiceHash, then transfer the funds to CoinBase ( NiceHash to CoinBase has 0 transaction fee when account is linked).
3. Then I have linked my BitPay account to CoinBase (BitPay can use Coinbase directly when linked, so no charge for using CoinBase through BitPay).
4. And Newegg accepts BitPay, so then I can purchase my items.

Just want to confirm if this chain makes sense to all you experienced users. Any help is greatly appreciated.

1618698001,Bitcoin,"Elon’s PlanWith Doge’s recent pump by Elon and a few other millionaire/billionaire’s, I have been thinking, why? One of my close friends got in on the frenzy early on. Buying doge at .02 (Robinhood) and holding until it hit .32. Their investment wasn’t much compared to their net worth, but it was quite a nice return. After he sold Doge, they immediately opened an account on Coinbase and used their profits to buy (random) coins to see if he has any luck with those as well. I think this may be Elon’s plan all along. Let people tip their toes in crypto, get a good return, and dive deeper into the crypto marketplace as a result. Eventually, these retail investors will pivot to crypto assets like BTC, which Tesla has a huge stake in. We all know that meme’s are designed to be viral by nature, and Doge (meme-coin) is the best vehicle for social propagation and acceptance. Thoughts?"

1618695631,Bitcoin,"No control over bitcoin or private keys, high markups, and no BTC to merchants... Is PayPal's Bitcoin adoption a PR stunt?PayPal made headlines in 2020 over its opening its door to bitcoin allowing customers to make purchases with 4 cryptocurrencies including bitcoin. 

Such acceptance from a payment giant surely bids well for bitcoin and crypto in general. But when we look into PayPal's cryptocurrency framework its offers to its users the picture is quite different. 

Key points to note:

* No private keys are held by the user
* Bitcoin cannot be moved to/from PayPal
* Outside wallets cannot be used to make bitcoin payments
* Merchants DO not receive any bitcoin, they receive fiat

When making a purchase the process is fairly standard, users are given a price along with the fee \[PayPal markup fee, not tx fee\]. Purchases are instantaneous. Outside bitcoin cannot be loaded into PayPal, neither can the bitcoin be withdrawn. 

Now, while making a purchase, the bitcoin is not actually getting transferred to the merchant, instead, the bitcoin is sold for fiat, and then the payment is made. 

In the entire process, no blockchain transaction took place. Only buy/sell of bitcoin for fiat. 

So in essence PayPal crypto pretty much acts like a PayPal coin, which can only be used on PayPal and nowhere else. Users have really no control over their crypto. 

While on one side people are happy that a company as big as PayPal started accepting crypto but is this really the way? The entire value of bitcoin and cryptocurrency is non-existant when using PayPal. And surprisingly, no one seems to be talking about this...

1618694485,Bitcoin,"Turkish Government positions its crypto ban as a way to protect usersOn Friday, the Central Bank of Turkey published[ regulations](https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2021/04/20210416-4.htm) which effectively banned the use of cryptos in the country.

While the ban itself isn’t surprising given the current political climate in Turkey, what’s interesting is the justification for this action.

According to the[ Turkish Government](https://www.tcmb.gov.tr/wps/wcm/connect/EN/TCMB+EN/Main+Menu/Announcements/Press+Releases/2021/ANO2021-17), this ban is being ***positioned primarily as a way to protect users of crypto assets from the risk of non-recoverable losses*** caused by:

* excessive market volatility
* stolen wallets
* irreversible transactions
* lack of supervision from a central regulatory authority

Tucked into the publication is the acknowledgement that cryptos include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments.

It’ll also be interesting to see how India’s speculated, upcoming crypto ban will be positioned.

After Powell and Yellen’s perceived negative comments about cryptos, it would be naïve to presume that the space will be allowed to operate in the US without some form of regulation in the near future.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **How do you feel about governments positioning crypto bans as a means to protect users? Is there merit to this?**
2. **If the government of your country bans cryptos will you comply?**"
1618694469,Bitcoin,"Is bitcoin overpriced?TLDR: If bitcoin is a security/investment instead of a currency, then where does its value actually come from, why is it priced so high, and how can it actually be a store of value?

I recently started working in the blockchain space and I feel like the more I learn about crypto the less I understand bitcoins current valuation. Both crypto and fiat currencies values are based on something tangible, ethereum through DApps, stable coins through tethers to fiats, and fiats through factors like GDP, inflation, and belief in the gov. Bitcoin on the other hand is purely a currency with no gov backing, no utility, and no tether to an item of tangible value. Now I understand that cryptos can have value despite having no correlation to something of intrinsic value. The part that confuses me is that bitcoin isn’t actually a currency, it doesn’t posses the properties to be one, and instead acts and is treated like a security. So if bitcoins value is centered around it being a currency and secure store of value but doesn’t actually have the properties to be such, then what makes it worth so much besides the belief in it and the markets bullish attitude towards it. Also let me be clear I am not hating on bitcoin or attempting to diminish it’s value, I’m just a genuine blockchain enthusiast looking for insight from people who have probably studied bitcoin more than myself. Thanks in advance :)"

1618791428,Bitcoin,"I have 4 different dated versions of an old BTC wallet from 2014 - Help seeing transactions + accurate balance + HD with a slash through it?So, I've attempted to figure this out for the past couple of years and wanted to finally reach out to the community.  


I have 4 different backed-up versions of my original BTC wallet from 2014 (a couple from Jan, one in March, and one in May).  They go up from 48kb (oldest version) to about 68kb (newest).  I've attempted to open each in BitcoinQT (core) to see any balances or transactions but have encountered a lot of issues and some outstanding questions. \[Fully synced at this point with the blockchain (350+ gigs)\].  


First, these wallets are *old* obviously.  Any time I open any of them they have HD with a  slash through them at the bottom right of QT client.  Could this be a potential reason why my transactions are not showing up?  Could this also prevent me from seeing my actual BTC balance in the wallet?  


Second, I know I had some transfers into the wallet *and* out of the wallet.  Yet, I have a bunch of random 'recent transactions' that are unconfirmed and have no balances (the specific addresses for sending and receiving BTC) when checking them on the blockchain.  I can't seem to find any of the **actual** transactions I made in the past - is there any way to sort this out and see them?  


Lastly, when using the console in QT core - I have attempted to read the debug log and see if anything is being read incorrectly or if there are any errors when opening these wallet files.  Are there any clear indicators to see if the wallet files may be corrupted?  Just odd that I can't see any true transaction history from the wallet (when I know without a doubt there have been a few). As stated before, this is not an HD wallet and has never been manually upgraded.  Honestly, not even touched since probably 2014 or so.  I would just love to see a true balance or at least transactional history to see what I sent/received in the past.  


I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this and help me out.  Driving me nuts trying to find my lost BTCs."

Reason: 

This is more than just finance. 

There are far less than 21 million BTC to ever be circulated considering the funds that were lost, seized, or inaccessible by their owners. 
Less funds in circulation naturally causes deflation.

The way you should think about this is that there is an x% chance this works out (appreciates 10x or more due to widespread adoption), and a y% chance that it doesn’t. NO ONE can tell you the values of x and y- but they are both non-zero. THERE IS a chance that this thing goes to 0. THERE IS ALSO a chance that this thing goes to 1M.

Invest what you can afford to lose. Never use leverage. DCA. Buy the dip. But set yourself up such for financial success even if this thing doesn’t work out.

Nourishing them. Keep them away from weeds, worms and insects. until they are big and full of fruit. One day you see they have all been cut  from the stem with a message like this : "" we think it's better for us not to have you here. Go away and we don't want you anymore""... 
This is exactly what happened to me on 15 April 2021 when I received a message from Localbitcoins so called investigation team that : We are informing you that your account has been terminated on 15 April 2021 . Therefore you have lost the right to use the terminated account"" .
It was so shocking that I first thought my account is hacked and reported it in a matter of seconds to the site. But later I realized that all parts of my account are locked and there is only a box available under the page which let me insert only 1 wallet address to withdraw my bitcoins out and a part to send messages to support!!!!
Are you serious??? 
I have been working here for more than 3 years. I have passed days and nights. Got scammed several times to know how your system works.lost lots of money. Made more than 7000 trades and 100% satisfaction rate of customers. I have made it to tier 3 ( latest tier on the system by providing all type of personal data ,vsource of funds, address , Tel,mail , filling lots of forms ). I had recruited all my power to make my brand in market as trustable and responsible trader. Helped lots of newbies. Did word of mouth marketing for you everyday....
In a blink of an eye I saw myself kicked out of the system. 
It's like somebody steal your most valuable asset in front of your eyes and you keep quiet without saying anything. 
Later on my clients start texting me why you are not online and some start sending me screenshots of their own accounts also being terminated. When I saw even traders with more history of trades were eliminated I found out that it was not about me and they did not found some errors or problem in my account and it should be something more serious and general. STH like an algorithm. A very flawful one. 

As far as I investigated they have ran an algorithm on the system to terminate traders who had sent or received from or to illegal wallets ( they should have access to a database of them ) 

I have had once sent to an illegal wallet which they blocked my account for 2 weeks. But as they asked me why you sent to this wallet I explained to them and send them kyc of client and screenshots of our chats and they accepted and opened my account. But again  I was filtered as doing trade with illegal wallets as it was in my trade history in the past . 
So you go to the court defend yourself come back home with success but 1 year later they send you to jail for forgetting you are clean and not only me . A lot of people arround the world. 
This is like a joke ...

The next day the red termination message is gone and you have more access on your account but no link to withdraw your coins and doing trades. Account suspended but with limited accessibility. Why??? 
It's clear. They did STH without prior study. 
People like me had many ongoing trades or disputes on the system which needs time to settle . I received buyers funds but I could not release the coins for them. Heh. Look at you. This is how you want to change the world for better? This is what comes out of your meetings? 


Now they are giving us 1 month to settle all the trades and then they terminate the account. They had make themselves prepared for this by asking their COO lady to come to an interview and say "" this elimination of traders does not have impact on our business"" 

I believe by this action and their new strategies nobody should invest in this platform. As one day you open your eyes and see a message that your account is terminated.

1618878848,Bitcoin,"New to Crypto - Couple questions regarding the current dip-n-bobsGreeting all,   


After giving Crypto the side eye for years (and cursing myself for not jumping in back then), I finally decided to jump into a couple of weeks ago.  Still have a lot to learn, but this board, among others has been a great help getting up to speed.  


With the recent dip, I managed to buy a couple hundred dollars worth of BTC at around 54k.  Of course, I know this is a long game (I've pretty figured out the HODL scheme for the most part), so don't mind sitting and waiting.  Tho over the past few days, I've been watching BTC back up to 60k+ back to 54k-ish.  I still have a couple hundred more USD that I can invest into BTC.  But I'm still not learning how the dips work.  Currently it's floating around 55k, should I buy more now, or hold out and see if it drops further?  I know a couple hundred USD isn't much, so I'm not worried bout it dropping super low.  But concerned if I wait too long, it'll spring back up to 60k+ and not drop again for a while.  So just wanted to get some general thoughts from you guys for my newbie investing.  :D  


Also, I've seen a couple of Crypto/BTC discords out there.  Anyone have any recommendations for a good one?  I've tried a couple, but they just seem to be a mess of random chat and memes. =/

**•Learn how to use your exchange app.** Seriously, make sure you understand all the basic tools in your exchange app.


**•Learn about [market cycles](https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-crypto-market-cycles/%3famp).** It's basically a term referring to long-term price pattern used when technically analysing price of cryptocurrencies, Market cycles are a long-term price pattern used when technically analysing price of cryptocurrencies, stocks or fiat currencies. The theory of market cycles is incredibly prevalent in cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin's price succinctly completing a full cycle no less than five times in its ten year history. During a cycle, some securities or asset classes outperform others because their business models aligned with conditions for growth


**•Don't chase hype.** [ Avoid FOMO](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kt6a4h/fomo_traps_to_avoid_beginner_guide_with/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) (fear of missing out) traps. Don't believe everyone who is shilling a coin. Always remember the adage: “If the shoe shine boys are giving financial advice, then it’s time to get out of the market."" Practice DD (Due diligence). Don't ever chase a coin that's gone up so much. Never consider a  miss out on potential profits as loss. Always do your own research (DYOR).


**•The market is not always like this.** Right now, it's a very volatile and bullish market. A lot of all these gains you see are not normal.


**•Please only invest money you are willing to lose.** Don't take out a loan, use rent money or other funds you can't afford to lose. No, seriously, there literally can't be any reasons to ever go against this rule. Ever! Only. Invest. What. You. Can. Afford. to. Loose.


**•Low cap coins, lets say anything not in the top 50 by circulating market cap, come and go like the wind.** These projects rarely stay around, they often can’t launch products, and most die a slow death on exchanges as founders and early investors dump them to zero drying up any liquidity that is there. Becareful with them and do a very thorough research before investing in anyone for the long term. Again, always DYOR.


•**Absolutely don't touch margin trading/leverage/futures/options unless you are a pro at all of the above.** Otherwise stay put in the relatively simpler world of spot trading.


**•Don't ever feel bad for for investing with small amounts, any amount is good; it will help you to learn.** No one cares if you've invested $100 or $1m. What matters is that you've taken a step for your future self, from which most of people are disconnected. No, this is no joke. [FMRI studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51738840_Future_self-continuity_How_conceptions_of_the_future_self_transform_intertemporal_choice) suggest that when you imagine your future self, your brain does something weird: It stops acting as if you’re thinking about yourself. Instead, it starts acting as if you’re thinking about a completely different person. So when you make plans for your future by investing even just a small amount in crypto, you've successfully broken that barrier and actively planned on your own behalf to create a better world and a better life for your future self. No one should make you feel anything but proud of this.


**•Your goal in long term investments are the high cap coins.** The top 30, 20, or more preferably top 10 that have been around for a while. Or other altcoins whose projects you've done diligent research on and truly believe they'll grow immensely and contribute to the crypto sphere and tech in general.


**•[Learn to spot pump and dumps (PnDs)](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lb4zsv/with_the_recent_influx_of_new_users_i_decided_to/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and runaway from them!** Also, learn strategies for recovering from these dangerous schemes if you've fallen for one. Trust me, greed and high-risk will not help you recoup your losses.


**•Whatever low experience, always remember there are thousands of skilled traders out there today who've experienced the same and even worse.** Trust me, you'll recover. 


**•Never place all your trust on Technical analysis alone.** They can disappoint you like that highschool friend that always never stood up for you especially when the bullies (whales) showed up to deal with you. They're also almost pure horseshit when dealing with low cap coins.


**•Understand [basic trade psychology](https://www.google.com/amp/s/academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-psychology-of-market-cycles.amp)**, especially during uptrends and downtrends. And always keep an eye out for potential cognitive biases like confirmation bias, loss aversion, endowment effect and others that may greatly influence your decision making. 


**•If you're not willing or ready to commit yourself to a lifetime of learning, you shouldn't be trading or investing in cryptocurrencies.**
 

Bonus: Don't forget to always help out other newbies when you've become more accustomed to the market. And never forget: **You were once at the bottom looking at the top for advice. Humility is king!**


Any other tips would be very much appreciated.

I decided to test this further with a much smaller amount and had another address generated for the same wallet and a similar situation occurred. Is there any way of figuring this out or are they just gone forever? I've loaded the wallet into Electrum and I don't even see either wallet address as an available receiving address. Additionally I've looked at the wallets xPub key and there is zero transaction history. I've verified on both web and IOS that neither address was spoofed or compromised. SOL or what?"

1618865442,Bitcoin,"An Open Letter To Those Who Are Considering Buying BitcoinI rewrote this 4 times. I hope it helps. FYI, I suffer from severe depression and mood swings :)

Bitcoin is worth 1.05 trillion/56k per coin.

We can discuss money printing, zero rates, blah blah blah. Or we can skip to the fun stuff and answer the question: Is bitcoin the new beverly hills?

Is bitcoin the new beverly hills? Well, why is beverly hills valuable? Is it a great piece of land with natural resources? Does it have amazing views? Does it have the lowest tax laws? 

Beverly hills actually does have oil wells, but that's not why people pay a shitload to live there today. They pay a shit load because 99% of people are not allowed to live there. I know it's hip to talk about all inclusive societies, but people vote with their \[fake\] dollars. A neighborhood is a network, and beverly hills represents one of the most exclusive networks. There's a high cost to enter, and multiple barriers to entry.

IMHO, bitcoin is the beverly hills of assets. Not digital assets. Of assets. Period.

89% of bitcoin has been mined. In 3 years 450 bitcoin will be made a day. Tesla's purchase was about 50,000 bitcoin-so that size purchase in 3 years will equal nearly 4 months of supply. 

The painful question is this: do you want ownership in this network?

The way I see it is that of the 18 million coins, at least 2 million are lost. I believe at least half of holders won't sell for several reasons: they are true believers, but also they bought at much lower prices and have no reason to sell. So, we have about 8 million coins for sale, MAX, at any price (I'd say for arguments sake some of them start selling at $1,000,000.

What I believe we are seeing is a massive rush to join the most exclusive network in the world. A new beverly hills, or monaco, if you prefer.

Why live in this neighborhood? Why pay so much? Simple: the chance something really really stupid is going to happen in the main city.

So why isn't everyone running to go to beverly hills? Well, that's for you to figure out.

But I have decided I want to live in beverly hills.+"

Not for environmental reasons or for any other reason that all the FUD news is screaming about right now.  I simply can't see central banks losing their ability to print money. Now of course, this has detrimental interest problems when abused. But is expansionary fiscal policy not important for increasing real GDP? With the idea being that an increase in Real GDP per capita improving the living standards. (Lets assume it doesn't only help a select group as I am aware some people are left behind). I am asking as increased demand and supply shocks that aren't taken advantage of mean that eventually we will return to Y=Y\*. When instead we could have an increased GDP. Or am I missing something (assuming BTC replaces GDP).

I get it ""Not possible"" right, reason? Institutions, adoption, what else, post halving, etc... Yea all the legit reasons, but the funny thing you forgot one thing ""GREED"" and you as 95% of people are probably in the delusion that now with institutional money BTC cannot drop to such a low price right = WRONG! Institutions are not traders and they are not holders, they are controllers of other people money, but that is not the point big institutions control other people money and you know it is not smart to play with other people money they can get angry if they don't make profit right, ofc that is correct don't F with other people money. Institutions didn't see a single bear market they enter the post bear market for BTC first time in the game, traders can survive big losses, holers don't care right, some of them will hold for years no problem there. But let me tell you something you will witness with your eyes soon and see on exchanges... those same institutions that participated in this bull run will first exit on you, name of their game is manipulation, they are professionals at that, they don't care about you, me or any other than their selfish interest to be profitable and make more money to their investors so they can give them more money for control, they cannot tolerate the risk of losing 15-30% or more like 50% drops in crypto be sure they have risk management they will first sell why? because they are professionals lol cat knows another cat, they know that it is just a question of when will first big holder of BTC as ( institution ) dump everything and start the bear market this time, they have the interest to buy more from you when you sell ofc that is how you make money.... institutions are not good as you think for Bitcoin but they are a necessary evil... so think again before thinking we are going on hopium road of 100k-150k-200k this cycle. Idiotic YouTubers keep shilling and shit-posting illusions that will make people lose everything if they don't have the knowledge behind it and understand the market. Yes, I'm calling it here, BTC will drop below 40k as time goes now, and possibly we will have the shortest bear market because they are loaded with cash to buy it cheap and they want it cheap. All will start with the first institution's dump, hopium idiots will lose everything. Altcoin / token holders will get annihilated at about 70-90% price drops."

He basically says how since a large amount of the hash power is concentrated in countries other than the US (China) if we (United States) chose to utilize bitcoin as our reserve currency, it could potentially be a huge risk as we are essentially relinquishing our power as the dominant global power. 
Basically, there is no way to ensure that 51% of the bitcoin network is NOT owned by a single entity. This is potentially extremely dangerous..

1618952701,Bitcoin,"A common misunderstanding about why keeping your coins on an exchange is dangerous...It feels to me that a huge number of people dismiss the risk of keeping your coins on an exchange because they are looking primarily at the risk of being hacked - that is, the risk is that if the exchange is hacked (as with MTGox) you’ll lose your coins without recourse. Compared to the risk of being hacked as an individual holding their own keys, this risk doesn’t seem particularly high (and I would agree that the risk of a typical individual losing their coins that way is higher than the risk of a reputable exchange being catastrophically hacked). 

BUT, the real risk of exchanges that most people will face, and which IS a relatively real and common risk, is that exchanges have the power to lock you out of your own account; withhold withdrawal of your coins; change and manipulate fee structures in exorbitant ways; institute arbitrary / unfulfillable KYC requirements; and so on. Obviously many folks already understand this, but for those of you considering leaving your coins perpetually on an exchange primarily on the risk calculus of hacking-based loss... you’ve now been formally warned."

1618952079,Bitcoin,"The energy FUD fallacy: Energy -&gt; Security reverse causation fallacy""Bitcoin wastes too much energy, it's bad""  


Energy fudder have easy time to say this, most Bitcoiners wrongly answer ""yes but worth it"" and try their best to show that it is not wasting anyway ([this one](https://www.coindesk.com/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption) for example, very good article with state of the art references but it is so TLDR)  


But here is the simple thing: even saying ""Bitcoin consumes energy"" is bullshit, as bullshit as saying:

* The faster that windmills are observed to rotate, the more wind is observed. Therefore, wind is caused by the rotation of windmills.
* Children that watch a lot of TV are the most violent. Clearly, TV makes children more violent.
* People that have cancer often smoke. So cancer makes you smoking
* The price is higher when hashrate is higher so hashrate explains the price of Bitcoin

This is [reverse causality fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation#B_causes_A_(reverse_causation_or_reverse_causality)). You observe that two things are correlated, but have no idea how it works and you infere a causation but in the wrong direction while the correlation observed was totally explained by the causation in the good direction.  


Applied to energy FUD: The higher the security of Bitcoin, the more energy Bitcoin consumes, therefore Bitcoin consumes energy to provide security &lt;- THIS IS A FALLACY

It is not Bitcoin which consumes energy, it is energy which must be consumed through Bitcoin (like [Bitcoin mining with flared gas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkeZVcGsva8) to reduce emissions). I think we need to go back to a more fundamental level on how the Bitcoin protocol works and recall this simple fact: if X% of the power consumed in Bitcoin is used for something else or unavailable, mining difficulty will be adjusted so that mining a block need X% less energy. Bitcoin security doesn't come from the amount of energy invested in Bitcoin mining but from the fact that **it is less profitable to use this energy to fork the blockchain than to follow the main one.** Bitcoin need a block reward currently, and will need transaction fees for that (and I am not worried at all about this), nothing more. Miners are just like any users of Bitcoin protocol.  


TLDR: Bitcoin needs zero energy (in fact just the one to run the full nodes which is nothing), but energy needs Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a measure of wasted energy because it fixes a minimum price for it, energy fudder want to shoot the messenger pretending they care about energy sobriety, ironic."

1618952018,Bitcoin,"The True Power Of Bitcoin To Change The World Is Via ....Charity!Hello Friends,

I’m sure we’ve all made a ton of money during this bull run, but wanted to share the true power of Bitcoin and what it is really about.

It’s not just about the GAINZ, but actually changing the world!

Since Nov 2020 I have been running a charity with some other like minded people in latin america, where we took our crypto gains and invested them in feeding the poor. 

In countries that do not have a welfare state, the worldwide economic hardships we are facing are hurting them the most.

Most of these people have little savings, and are day labourers, meaning an economic shutdown means they will starve.

So we decided to help these people as much as we could, by feeding them.

We run 1 event a week, feed roughly 100-130 people depending on various factors. While we wish we could do more, this charity is 100% self funded, and running these events costs us about $1200 USD a month in food alone.

If you all are interested, I can share exactly how we do our charity events. Unlike traditional big charities, we don’t spend all our money on overhead, having at most 10% earmarked for overhead. Also, since we have other businesses we can’t spend more than a day or two a week on this without hiring more staff. So we run the events in such a way that we maximize our time and $.

But if we can inspire others to copy us, I think people all over the world could use this model to do charity.

Let me know in the comments if you guys/gals are interested and I’ll do a post on exactly how we run the events and risks etc when running them.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is our IG which we haven't really promoted, or uploaded much of the content we have from our events.

I personally started laugh crying to Michaels 1 min response to risk factors where he went point by point leader by leader who confiscated gold over the last millennia. 

Anyone think Frank had some good points?
One stood out to me as a good point. 
His point was that Michael’s compound annual return metric he uses for Bitcoin (200%) is a bit disingenuous because Michael is starting from $1 BTC all the way up to 60k BTC and because most BTC holders didn’t get in at $1 price it’s a bit of a stretch because most of the huge gains were front loaded in the early years which distorts the mean. 

I say that with a 1m price target for myself so I def think even at these prices you will have incredible gains even further but Michael’s model could use some tweaking in my opinion (to reflect the average retail holder). I’m curious what the mean CAR would be if you started from 17 on where it became a conversation piece in the public zeitgeist."

A few days ago\* I posted about money management because I see too many loss posts from beginners. Even if it was not a big success, I'll keep going with my next subject.

There is a statement attributed to Mike Tyson saying everyone has a plan until punched in the face, or something to that effect. All my live I've been involved in sports, mostly in martial arts and (you saw it coming) boxing. As anyone with a minimal experience in any combat sport can tell you, the first thing you learn when you get into a match is that there is no way you are getting out of a ring without getting punched a few times. Even if you win.

The bull market makes every new trader think he is a financial genius. High return, no losses. Until they get punched in the mouth by the next dip. We all thought we could win any fight as kids, because all we knew about fighting was from TV. Once in a real fight, you realized people wouldn't get dizzy and wait for the next hit, as in wrestling, and probably got your ass kicked a couple times.

But how to get ready for the next price dip? How to get my lunch money back? What does any of this have to do with this sub?

The main issue is people misunderstood Tyson. He was not saying the plan wouldn't work, but that his opponents would panic and abandon their strategy as soon as they realized it was not foolproof. No strategy is right 100% of the time and, in trading, if your strategy is winning 60% of your trades, you are getting amazing results.

After managing your money so you won't go broke and before testing a few hundred strategies you found online, you need to understand you are dealing with an unpredictable market and no strategy can predict the future and, for that, a few rules must be followed.

1 - Learn to walk before you run

As I said in my later post, treat trading as the business it is. Paper trade, test your strategy live and with past data. You will have to fix it a couple times but, once it works, go live with the minimal amount possible. If you can't win a penny, you can't win a million.

2 - Stick to the plan

If every time a trade goes wrong you change plans, you will be eaten by the market. In backtesting there is something called drawdown. It is how much you would have lost at some moment in time if using that strategy. If it says you would have lost 50% before winning, know this can happen. If you freak out when your portfolio shrinks 10%, don't trade or try another strategy.

3 - He may have a gun

Know when to run. Set a hard stop to your strategy and accept it needs improvement. If you tested, paper traded, fixed and it still is giving bad results, run back to the drawing board.

Does artificially effecting hash rate make a 51% attack more successful through lower difficulty?If I'm a country and I own 65% of the hashrate on date X. Then on date X the difficulty adjustment occurs up, then on date X +1 I shut off half my hash rate of my country so now I own 32% of the hashrate. So I gum up the system and make it so the difficulty next cycle will be lower. Date X +14 comes and the difficulty drops because on average the hash rate is down by 32%. Once that difficulty drops to accommodate a lower hash rate, I turn on that 50% of the hashrate again plus maybe another 5% of the global hash rate. Now once again I own 65% of the global hash rate and now the difficulty is set as if I'm only running half of that.

What if I already had 51% (technically China as a country does own over 50% of the hashrate), then artificially drop my hashrate to half or less, then once the difficulty adjustment comes I start that hash rate back up. So now not only do I have over 50% of the hashrate but I have it at a lower difficulty. Meaning 10min per block will not be upheld. It will be 5 min on average. That also benefits a 51% attack. Having 51% of the hashrate matters but also improving the odds that your 51% can find the solution faster matters which is what the difficulty adjustment does.

Tell me why this might not be an issue in 12 days. I dont need to hear how bitcoin is superman. I need to know how this is mitigated by a rigid system like bitcoin."

 a1d57573b7593619153e6caf4a6c15b3b18b9f224cc5958d2a4c743e2518ecff   is the hash.  She is using Edge wallet on a mobile device which complicates things, Blockchair says the transaction has RBF disabled sadly, but I am not sure if I am reading the page correctly. I thought all modern wallets had RBF enabled by default, I know electrum does?

I was going to advise her to try doing RBF with a higher fee and a wallet she owns, and hope that it confirms before the scam one.  But she can't find the RBF option, so I'm guessing it was disabled for the transaction after all.

I also read about double-spending, but again she is a novice BTC user and the wallet won't support double-spending it seems.   I told her she is probably out of luck, but I wanted to ask anyway if there's a chance  to  cancel or re-direct the TX  before it has any confirms?

If not, I know BTC fees have been obscene lately,  well she used a low fee of 46sat/B, what are the chances of the TX simply getting stuck for 2 weeks and then automatically returning?  It's a low fee but it isn't a high B transaction. It has 388 bytes, does anyone think it will time out  or will it eventually confirm in a few days?"

I can tell you why.

Can bitcoin reach up to 30% increase in a year or is it very slow?

Question 2:
If not then is bitcoin volatile and unreliable?

Question 3:
Is crypto currency worth doing at a young age?

It amazes me that most people I encounter that just entered the crypto world have such a short term mindset. They hope to get rich with little investments on a short time period.

Not that I am in big time I believe in the projects I invested in so why would I sell? We not even close to world adoption.

Please put in the time to do some research and invest in projects you believe in. Widen your horizon to like at least 5/10 years and don't see a dip or crash as the end of the world. We always recover; It is actually an oppurtunity to accumulate for discount prices! Money will come to the patient!"

1619129316,Bitcoin,"Objective Opinion on the DipFirst to get this out of the way, yes I am new to bitcoin and subsequently new to Reddit.  My avg buy-in price (started in early March) is $53k.  So I am currently under water.

The last few days have been emotional.  I get it.  I have been going back and forth with doubting my decision to go (pretty heavy) into bitcoin.  Watching a portion of your wealth evaporate by -25% in a few days sucks.  

The perspective I am offering is that a week ago, everyone was on top of the world and BTC was going to hit $250k by EOY.  Now, I am seeing calls for $20k, BTC won’t be around in 30 years, yada yada yada.  The 180 degree emotional change is ridiculous when you think about it.

The fundamentals with bitcoin have not changed:
- No significant government action, yet.  And the SEC Commissioner just said today that “we can’t really ban it”.  Regulation is coming, I think you’re a fool if you don’t believe this.  But it likely won’t change the utility of this asset.
- The network is still pristine and the recent decline isn’t related to a hack or integrity issue.
- I am seeing interest from tech groups to create sustainable power grid support for the bitcoin network.  Would be awesome if this was rolling out before the next halving.  This will eliminate environmental FUD and help reduce dependency on Chinese electricity
- Corporations will likely continue to invest in Bitcoin, even at the $45-55k price range.  I believe we are weeks away from a fairly significant corporate announcement of treasury-acquired BTC holdings.  And more will come.
- It sounds like a ETF will eventually get approved in the US.  I think Ginsler will be totally supportive of this.  Once Boomer money comes into BTC, we’ll propel to new highs, whether we’re in a halving cycle or not....

So just ask yourself:  what has changed about Bitcoin other than a likely short-lived dip?"

Buy what you like the idea of and push all other ideas that improve the idea or are just riding the wave.

1619225828,Bitcoin,"How would Bitcoin deal with the COVID stimulus packages?Hey, I'm new to Bitcoin and I really want to learn more about it. I was wondering how Bitcoin would allow for a country's government to release stimulus packages in emergency situations like during COVID? Is it even possible for them to do so due to the fixed supply? If it's not possible, what would an alternative be for extreme situations that would require quick money printing? 

Also, is the consensus view that Bitcoin will destroy fiat currency or that currencies like the USD will be fixed to a certain amount of Bitcoin making Bitcoin a digital (and much more practical) version of gold during the gold standard days?

I would really appreciate help in answering these questions.

For example the first Internet IPO was in 1995 and today we have the first crypto IPO with coinbase so we are likely in 1995 for the internet.

They say this like bitcoin will have a blow off top in 3 or 4 years and see something equivalent to the dot com bubble.

But the internet was not replacing money..

If the internet was replacing money and its success meant the collapse of the dollar then how could the dot com bubble ""burst"" when the dollar is falling just as fast as the internet companies.

If bitcoin is successful and the dollar starts collapsing, even if bitcoin falls it will appear to simply be moving sideways in dollar terms as the dollar is the denominator.

This is why its actually possible that bitcoin has a huge rise and then goes sideways once it has achieved enough success to displace the dollar."

Buy big and be rewarded... or else buy big and be retarded. God bless!"

1619214982,Bitcoin,"I met this guy online and he is claiming to help me to get money with cryptoSo as the title says I met this guy online he is very apathetic but kind at the same time, so I didnt knew anything about cryptocurrency untill i met him and i took some deep dives and know a little bit about it now but nothing in practice. So he talks about that he does node income and that the best thing for me to make profit is to atleast deposit 1000 euros, and after that just follow his steps with screenshots thru texting. Now for me thats a lot of money but I low key trust him because I asked him why he would help a stranger and his answer was practically that he want us to work together and that he is also investing in himself.

I don know but as I said I lowkey trust him but I also have this voice in the back of my head saying: well what if he steals your money? Says do this and this, and because I am new to this area of wallets I am afraid that he is going to make me screenshot or make me do something that my money transfers to him? Is that even possible? Thats why I am here for advice because you guys seem experienced"
1619214752,Bitcoin,"Stop seeing Bitcoin as stocks Let me tell you my brain is on the smooth side but I've got my 2 cents ready.

I see a lot of comparing market caps of coins with companies which is an irrelevant parameter to compare. Essentially the idea with all crypto's is that they're finite, shares don't have to be. If we're comparing cryptos to traded assets lets compare them with commodities like gold and oil. It's way closer to what type of instrument crypto is. And if we're really being picky, cryptos shouldnt be more than a swappable currency which you can offer product in. 

Wrapping my little brain-fart up. I think our trading platforms are warping the view we should have of crypto currency. when cryptos got traded the platforms they're traded on are almost exact copies of investment platforms, even giving coins tickers and offering options like calls and puts. 

Stop seeing crypto's as stocks and more as currency so we can finally go to an age of using bitcoin instead of dollars at any store."

She is also rude. There’s a better support community on YOUTUBE COMMENTS of FREE videos that anyone can watch, for free. 

I found myself going back to those YouTube videos I Never fully watched and actually ended up learning more.

1619212913,Bitcoin,"BTC as a hedge against inflationCan someone explain this to me?   From my understanding this only holds true if BTC grows faster than the rate of inflation for FIAT money.  For instance, if I have $100 USD and it loses half its value in 5 years so that $200 USD now has the same buying power as $100 USD did 5 years previous.  Wouldn't BTC have to, at minimum, double in value to have retained its value vs. the same USD? 

Obviously BTC has been growing at a rate much higher than inflation, but if this was not the case, is there anyting inherent to BTC that makes it valuable as a hedge against inflation?"

1619307693,Bitcoin,"Wild Ride - looking back at the past few yearsI started buying crypto in 2017 and watched the price screen on Coinbase when bitcoin hit 20,000. I had been buying it from 10-16k. Then, it began to fall and I started selling. I also had coins in a Binance account. Eventually, I got out with a small loss. Two years ago BC dropped into the 3-4k range and I was happy to be out. Literally all of the financial gurus said BC was useless and might go to 0. 

Well, BC was back to 10k 6 months ago - and since then it's been skyrocketing. I have no idea where the price will go in the future, but traders are now thinking that it might replace the US Dollar or Gold as an alternative form of global currency. Just looking at the price chart over the past year it seems that the BC price began to rise dramatically after the November elections. This might reflect uncertainty about US fiscal and monetary policy going forward, or might just be a coincidence. With BC you never know what's really driving the price. But, the long term trend is certainly up, but the pullbacks are just massive. Same with the other ""coins"". 

I have to remind myself that the term ""coin"" doesn't mean that there are actual hard assets involved - just computer code, and nobody really knows what anyone will use these ""coins"" for in the future. But, people are still buying them and trading them. Even if they were just imaginary numbers, a case could be made for trading them. If the prices go up and down, then it's possible to trade them and make some money - or lose money. In the long run, I think most of the guru's have changed their tune from BC is useless and going to zero, to maybe it's the future of global currency and will be worth who knows how much. At least there can only be 21 million BCs, right? So, owning BC isn't like owning paper currency that can be devalued by printing more. 

So, it has been and will be a wild ride. Seems the people who are doing well are just holding on for dear life - like being on a roller coaster with no restraints."

Been waiting 5 daysI know apparently the BTC fees are outrageously high right now but as I was used to them being pretty cheap the last time I made a BTC payment I just used a $2.50~ fee and here I am 5 days later and my transaction is still pending

It's replace-by-fee but unfortunately I don't have any more money to be able to bump the fee up so that's not really an option for me and I'm stuck waiting, do you guys think it will take much longer or could it just not send at all? Longest I've had to wait for a transaction to go through previously was around 3 days but that was a couple of years ago

I'm not super savvy with all this crypto stuff (I buy it, and buy stuff with it but that's about it) so I'm not sure how I can get a good estimate on it

I feel like #ont will be huge going forward. It is working to not only solve user cases but also decentralized identity. I think its one of the best project to hold. 

Last time bullrun all time was $11 usd when btc was @11k only. It has lot Of upside , in the accumulation zone, barely trading at $1.40 as of now. 


200 million #ont are locker in staking , current staking candidate nodes paying 35-45 APY 

200 million is locked in contract 

Only 600 million is circulating supply, and has a very strong team which was behind #neo. 

It is matter of time before we see All time high again #ont , it will help #defi by leaps and bounds, and also give high earnings on staking by just holding it. 

Check out, i think its one of the best alts to hold and buy around these price when every other project 20-30x and ontology has long way to go and has not come out of accumulation, that is opportunity for alot of you.

1619302086,Bitcoin,"real inflation ratesIn 2010, there was a pretty famous study about 75k being the inflection point for a diminishing return on reported levels of happiness.

This year, a much deeper data study debunked that. The inflation adjusted income of 80k did not correlate with the ""sweet spot"" of happiness.

I'm writing this for an REIT, so I took a look at homeownership as a control. in 2010, the average cost of a home was 279k. At 75k income, that's about 3.7x your annual income.

In 2021 at 80k (""inflation adjusted""), the average cost of a new home is 409k....5.1x your annual salary.

I'm posting this to point out what. crock of shit inflation rates are. The 80k was determined off of federally reported inflation rates between 2010-2021. In just ten years time, if someone got the ""inflation raise"" consistently, they would be **8 years** further behind on a mortgage (and that's assuming you have 20% to put down NOW)

And I'll be honest this has changed the way I view the future completely , I been super scared of what the world will be like in the next 30 years and for some reason this week I went deep like super deep on bitcoin, blockchain, crypto, technical analysis, the fucking michael sailors of this world I don't even remember the names of the stuff I watched because I just been obsessed 24/7 trying to accumulate as much information as I can. 
Funny thing is I don't even care about making money out of this, there's a lot of ways to make money but nothing compares to bitcoin, I feel like if you own bitcoin you own a piece of the new world , the world of value , the world where you are not controlled by the government. Bro I'm sounding like a fucking utopian , rewind back one week I was making music 24/7 not giving a fucking about anything , I'm gonna try to control this new ""addiction"" because I need to do other stuff as well , and i've put everything off in my life this last week just to stay at home watching podcasts, reading books and looking at the bitcoin community which is the most inspiring force in the world right now , unlike something I've ever seen.

1. He lived in the same town as Hal Finney for 10 years (first Bitcoin recipient ever) so its possible that they knew each other.

2. Also, he said this when talking about Bitcoin: ""I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.""

He said he is no longer involved, which means he was involved.

3. His name is Satoshi Nakamoto. Not saying this means that he is definitely a creator of Bitcoin just because of his name, it could be a pure coincidence, but still.

The reason he said he wasn't the creator of Bitcoin is to protect himself. It's obvious.

1619297372,Bitcoin,"Newbie Bitcoin QuestionsHello, I invested into bitcoin because i may as well add it to my portfolio but i’m still unclear of some bitcoin things.

1. Why do so many people here treat it as a HODL investment when the dips can drop a lot more then rise back faster than stocks. It looks like there’s a lot of potential buying and selling every couple weeks.

2. The cap is 24 million bitcoins so I hear a lot that it can’t be manipulated by inflation but the fact you can just keep lower into decimal value contradict this? And wouldn’t it start getting confusing having bitcoin as a main currency if for example a banana was listed at 0.00001 btc at the grocery store?

3. What does it being decentralised really mean since wouldn’t governments always have a say whether it can be legal tender. They could make it illegal to trade it tomorrow if they wanted to right?

4. What Youtube channels/resources have made accurate predictions on Bitcoin that are worth following?"

So Bitcoin **isn't** perfect and centrals banks **aren't the devil**. It might surpried you but i actually think they are trying they best to improve the situation for everyone.

But they know what is going to happen and they continue for three reasons (in my opinion)

\- first they are not going to be the most injured by the crisis

\- they can't fight agains't the entire global system : our system is made to make us consume : inflation isn't a big deal if everyone consume.

\- they have no other choice

Bitcoin is great and a way better than the actual system. But if the system is crashing it's not only because of centrals banks but because many things aren't healthy in this system. 

Stop hating them when the big cash wich is preparing is going to come it won't be easy even for some of us : we can't be happy that the system is dying it will change things for sure but at what price ?

They will be wars (may be civil ones) many destitudes, people starving, ect ... No one want that to happen. Continue to accumulate sats but don't hope for the worst (which would prove you were right)."

I have also been active in the stock market.  Buying, selling, options...you name it.  Added to that, I have more than a few rental properties so I'm not exactly new to real estate.  I've spent quite a bit of time lurking in the bitcoin and cryptocurrency subreddits as well as the options, stocks, wallstreetbets and yes, even GME subreddits.

After having spent so much time in those subreddits, it hit me like a ton of bricks today...

# The whole financial system is broken.

It is a rigged and broken system that heavily favors those that already have the money and power. 

I know you guys and gals probably already knew that, or at least suspected.  I fall in that suspected category of people, but I never really put much thought into it.  I just figured that I would work hard and try to do enough so that I could take care of my family and have a decent retirement.

I honestly think that the system is so broken and crooked it will eventually collapse in on itself.  At the very least, the 99% will be so oppressed that there will be nothing left to do than to go after the 1%.  That is not a world that I want to me or my family to be a part of.

# Cryptocurrency solves all of this!

Cryptocurrency levels the playing field.  ANYONE can get ahead in life with cryptocurrency.  There are many great projects out there that fill the need that the current financial system is controlling (real estate, savings, buying goods and services, transportation, medicine, security, etc.) and it's all ***DECENTRALIZED***.  With cryptocurrency, no one person or entity controls those aspects of your life.

I'm sooooo close to actually dumping everything I own into those crypto projects that could take the power away from those that corrupt the system.

Ok.  I've put my tinfoil hat away and I'm done rambling.  I just wanted to share my thoughts.  Thanks for reading."

But I do not understand one point: Why does the price drop when big fish / most people sell it? I mean if there is a seller, there is a buyer who buys it, right? Or from the other pov: When people buy it and it raises, they buy it from sellers, not? Why does the price / value drop? There is always an equal buying to the selling. I am confused..

I transfered $4k from wallet to exchange the other day. I needed it within a specific time period so I opted for max gas. The fee for that came out to around $50, and it still took around 2 hours for it to transfer to the exchange, sell it, then the transfer. The transfer from exchange to account took just over an hour, with fees (very minor) as well. It's kind of disappointing. It's not my first transfer by all means but it was something that made me think about it. My bank account charges a flat fee of just $1.11 for an etransfer which is lightning fast (max an hour if it's a new recipient) and PayPal is the same, if not any fee if you're doing Friends and Family. Perhaps I'm still green after over a year with crypto, but it was something that bugged me. 

Convince me: If it's slower than a bank transfer and more money in fees, why should the average person want to switch over and use it as the new way of paying? Not talking about investments or anonymity or in case of a financial crash. I'm talking strictly every day living/buying."

Talk about volatile: Bitcoin price fell 18% in the past week, as of Friday afternoon, according to Coindesk. But it was up 587% over the past year. That gain has your attention. So you want in on the action. But how much should you invest? Way less than you might expect, according to top financial advisors.
There are different ways to invest in Bitcoin. The question is, should you? And as for how much of your portfolio to put into Bitcoin and its proxies, take a deep breath, advisors say. In a random sampling by IBD, advisors recommended less than a 10% weighting, if any at all.

Bitcoin Price: Potential Risks Of Playing Bitcoin

Advisors point out the potential risks of owning Bitcoin. ""I am not actively recommending cryptocurrency,"" said Kimberly Foss, president and founder of Empyrion Wealth Management, in Roseville, Calif. ""At this point, the market is too unproven, too unregulated and too prone to manipulation, both by actors with potentially nefarious motives and also by other forces that are at present not well understood.""

Only Invest What You Can Afford To Lose

The crux of the risk is the volatility of Bitcoin price.
As a result, only individual investors whose risk tolerance is moderate or stronger should even consider investing in Bitcoin, says Terry Sawchuk, CEO of Sawchuk Wealth, in Troy, Mich. ""Only invest what you can reasonably afford to lose,"" Sawchuk said. Both Bitcoin and competing cryptocurrency Ethereum have been known to drop by more than 10% in a single day, and up to 80% in a year or less.
The odds of those kinds of drops are probably lower now due to cryptocurrencies' popularity, Sawchuk says. And the fact that many large institutions are putting money into both of these currencies is a stabilizing force. They tend to not panic-sell. ""At a certain level they're more likely to buy more"" on a price dip, he said. The markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum have matured to the point where, while still volatile, ""I think the chances of them going to zero are very low,"" Sawchuk said."

Big props first of all to Swan Bitcoin. They had my institutional account set up in barely over a week. This blew my mind as I had already been trying to get accounts at other places like Gemini and Coinbase for many weeks. 

I am a hodler, but also want the ability to liquidate if I absolutely must. The downside to Swan is you can only buy (well, maybe it's an upside!), so I really wanted another institutional account \_somewhere\_ that would allow me to sell.

I heard on the ""Tales from the Crypt"" podcast that there are very few US exchanges that support lightening -- one of them was River Financial. I searched them and found that they do not offer institutional accounts, but I could submit a little questionnaire explaining my use case. I explained how unfriendly most exchanges are to us self-directed IRA guys and how they could probably scoop up some sweet business if they offered a product for us folks. Well, I got an email back that seemed to start the process of establishing an institutional account. I responded to the email and filled out the forms they requested.

Long story short, in just a few hours, start to finish, they fully set up my account and I made a purchase. Their fees are a little higher than Swan, but I almost vomited watching BTC dip to 47k and drive up to 54k before I was able to buy, so I was happy to pay the extra fees before I suddenly find the price sitting at $100k!!!

Thank you River Financial... and Swan Bitcoin!"

1619478676,Bitcoin,"Seasonality in Bitcoin Hashrate and Average Rainfall in Sichuan, ChinaOriginally, this project was going to test correlation between bitcoin's price and it's hashrate. As I dug into it, it seemed more and more like a useless enterprise and I kind of lost interest. However, in gathering the data, I read about a large drop-off (45%) in hashrate earlier this month (4/15/21). Looking into it further, most sources attributed this drop to blackouts in Xinjiang, China where a lot of mining operations are conducted (see Bitcoin mining map of China below). It was a strong indication of China's dominance in the Bitcoin mining, and further Googling found that sources attribute 60% of the global hashrate to China. This led me down another rabbit hole - geographic distribution (or rather concentration) of bitcoin mining in China, and got me wondering about the potential effects this might have on the total hashrate. 

A few articles I read touched on yearly miner migrations within China - moving seasonally to areas where the rates of electricity are under-utilized and over-supplied. One of the biggest, if not the biggest driver of these migrations is hydro-electricity during the rainy season (Jun-Sep), mainly in the Sichuan and Northern Yunnan provinces. Dams like Xiluodu (3rd largest power station in the world) produce tons of cheap electricity for the region. What seems to happen is that many mining farms relocate to these areas during the rainy season, and transition back to areas with thermal power facilities (coal) like Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in the dry season. Rates for electricity during the wet season can be twice as cheap as those in thermal power. 

[Bitcoin Mining Map - Univ. of Cambridge](https://preview.redd.it/jgbd9el7glv61.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c03b7370de12d502b20667c435ac09d566a789eb)

I decided to test some of these numbers for myself - just to see if there was a recognizable pattern. For all you traders out there, I would have loved to have tied this to price action but the geeky side of me got a little carried away and this is mostly an academic endeavor. But hey, if you see some profitable insight here share the love and let a brother know! I plot hashrate vs. price at the end of this article if you are interested.

Here is a de-trended (more on that in a bit) box-and-whisker plot of average monthly hashrate for the last 3 years:

[Hashrate Trends 2018-2020](https://preview.redd.it/yfuv0vxkilv61.png?width=1434&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b3f4535abf9d527bac92fe5b83f355141921f12)

You can see a yearly increase in hashrate starting around May/June and dropping off again around October, coinciding with average rainfall in Sichuan:

[Average Rainfall in Sichuan \(Chengdu\)](https://preview.redd.it/bygag7goilv61.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76ecaf125620583238f959d133494b75ec9f123d)

In order to get this data and visualize any cyclical patterns, I had to correct for a large uptrend - a meteoric rise in hashrate over the last 5-6 years due to the recent popularity of crypto, the scaling of commercial mining operations, and better hardware i.e. higher hashrate, better energy efficiency (see hashrate graph below). If this correction wasn't made, all we'd see is a large increase in hashrate - and you wouldn't need this article to tell you that.

I started by running a series decomposition using Python's statsmodel library. It's used as a general indicator for trends/seasonality by calculating a trend line and seasonal patterns, but should be used as a weak indicator and taken with a grain of salt. I used to it make sure I was headed in the right general direction and to reference later. Since I was looking for a seasonal trend I aggregated average hashrate per month to see what, if any, seasonal patterns were present. Plotting out this decomposition gives you the following:

&amp;#x200B;

[Each ghetto snipping tool markup indicates a year](https://preview.redd.it/q2i390erjlv61.png?width=1090&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4ab541265802649ea5e0d2688d15c0dc29be38ca)

With this weak confirmation of seasonality present, I took it further by deconstructing my own means of trend correction with the intent to plot each year's monthly distribution of daily hashrate and see if the different years resembled each other. I used the NumPy .polyfit() module to do a polynomial regression on average daily hashrates from 2015-2021 (to represent the ""trend""), and then used the difference between the actual hashrate (observed) and the trendline (prediction) to create another dataset. What you see in the boxplots above are the distributions of these differences by month and year. 

**In plain English****, I was asking ""how much over or under was the actual observed hashrate compared to the hashrate predicted by the general uptrend?""**. The boxplots show that in the rainy months, the actual hashrate generally sits above the trend.

Here is the actual hashrates, in green, plotted against the trendline, in blue:

[Observed vs. Predicted Daily Avg. Hashrate](https://preview.redd.it/fingkqp8klv61.png?width=1397&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ed8410145729f6e76d29121674179f7550a828c)

Teasing out seasonality any earlier than 2017 was difficult to do as the average hashrates are comparatively so much smaller early years than in later years, that the regression line being used to represent the ""trend"" is a lot less representative in those earlier years. You can see in the plot above, that prior to 2017/2018 the trend line doesn't fit the data as well in a relative sense ('relative' being the key word here).

If I scrunch the timeline and the regression down to 3 years and run the regression then, it follows the trend a bit better but still doesn't give us anything too significant in terms of seasonality. You can see them below. A little better, but I think still skewed by external macro trends. Keep in mind that bitcoin mining is still in relative infancy - the ASIC was introduced 2013 and 2014-2016 marked the rise of China's dominance in mining with pools like Bitmain and Antpool. 

I imagine it takes a bit of time to learn and refine your operations so that large consolidated efforts like mining farm migration might not have been as prevalent in those earlier years. The data may also have been skewed by early regulatory disruptions like China shutting down exchanges in 2017.

**In conclusion (yay!)**, we can see that there is a disproportionate concentration of mining operations in China mainly due to an abundance of low-cost energy (sometimes subsidized), and in my humble opinion - a larger supply of low-cost, tech-savvy labor willing to live in the middle of butt-fuck nowhere to maintain mining farms (Read: Lower Quality-of-Life).  I know the crypto-world loathes the word ""centralization"" - generally following libertarian principles of self-sovereignty and free-market yadda-yadda-beep-boop. So on the surface this concentration seems like a bad or maybe even a dangerous thing, but the reality is that these miners account for a large portion of bitcoin's network security - and if they fucked around and the price of bitcoin tanked, they'd be hurting just as much as the next guy. It's in their interest to maintain network health and ensure enough liquidity for them to cash-in their efforts. So I think there's some general incentive-alignment there to put your mind at ease.

Like it or not, bitcoin mining in China is important to the crypto ecosystem as a whole, in the same way AWS is important to the internet ecosystem. For that reason, I think it's wise to continue to pay close attention to the dynamics of mining in China. For example, due recent efforts to meet climate change targets and push the carbon-neutral narrative, China is reportedly shutting down crypto-mining operations in Inner Mongolia, along with other energy-intensive industries.

How does this affect the distribution and competitiveness of China's bitcoin mining? What does it speak to more general questions - e.g. as Bitcoin's network value grows, how will we maintain the economic value of POW network security when it is directly tied to energy consumption - and can energy consumption scale in the same fashion? Currently the energy consumption of Bitcoin is comparable the total energy consumption of Kazakhstan, with a carbon footprint comparable to that of the country of Hungary. And that's *just Bitcoin*. If the price and hashrate trend continues, we're likely looking at more. So as we ask these questions, we should continue to keep a close eye on China's energy policy stances and the general landscape of bitcoin miners and their migrations in the region.

Not only that, with price fluctuations so wild, it doesn't make sense to use BTC for smaller transactions. $16.99/transaction (about 20 minutes ago) doesn't give BTC much room to talk when discussing it as a daily tool.

I'm a big fan of the Lightning Network, but I also understand the argument no-coiners have when discussing high fees. It's not sustainable.

So then, what do you see as a solution. What resources are out there that may help me see the other side.

Meanwhile, I send a transaction for $16.99 and then have to stay away from my computer for 30 minutes before going back. It's agony in a way."

I had an appifanie where I remember mining BTC in late 2015 or so with a computer application that had a smiley face on it. With a quick google, I remember it being NiceHash software for PC.

I ran this overnight for a while if I can remember right. I don't have any evidence of creating an online account in all of my old emails. Is there any way possible that I created a local wallet of some sort? I was only a teenager at the time and I don't remember and specific details.

I still have access to the PC that I used to run the application, but I would have to do some part swaps to get it in running order (custom built low end PC). I never did a reset on the data, so everything should still be original on the hard drive.

Any advice would be great, I remember not understanding how quantities of BTC worked so there could really be anything on here.

Thank you,"

1619475407,Bitcoin,"Tesla Selling BTC: A Bullish Sign?Wall Street expected Tesla to report EPS of 79 cents. Tesla reported $438 million net income. It sold bitcoin to realize $100 million in gains. This means 23% of Tesla's earnings were from BTC. This also means that without it, their 93 cents per share would have dropped 23% to 72 cents per share. Without BTC, Tesla would have failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.

What should this tell the market?

Companies should invest in BTC and hold the super appreciating asset to hedge against poor performing quarters. A company is stronger with BTC. 

Conclusion:

Tesla selling BTC says less about BTC than it does about Tesla. Nobody would sell their best performing asset unless it's necessary. In this case, it was necessary."

For example: 1 BTC was yielding 6% and as of May 1st (with less than a week of notice) BlockFi will reduce that to roughly 3.5%. Classic bait and switch. 

In response I’ve moved to withdraw half of my BTC from BlockFi. After processing my 3 factor withdrawal, BlockFi has flagged my deposit and demanded that I provide live biometrics for them to review. They’ll contact me in a few days about the biometrics and about THEIR DECISION to let me withdraw. 

In conclusion, HODLers “told me so” and if you’re currently using BlockFi now I’m prepared to pass that on to you. While I’m confident that I’ll part ways with BlockFi in possession of all my funds, I’ll also do so knowing the presence of red flags that most often associate to bad liquidity. To be clear, I think BlockFi is using intentional delays to get her liquidity because they’re over leveraged.

So Atomic Wallet is a scam. 

They take money, and will not trade. It goes to false addresses someone said it’s selective so that they keep running. So if your money is in it, and they have not targeted you that is why. You would have to trade to a coin that operates in coinbase to trade this will flag them, and they lock the trades so the addresses are false. Company takes the real transfer and keeps the coin. The other method of keeping your coin is upping the trade amount minimum so you buy more and can never trade. This increases the amount made in the system before you fail.

Any advice?So looks like I can't just import an Electrum wallet's .dat into Bitcoin Core due to how the wallet structure being different. Is there a way to import &gt;= 1000 private keys into Bitcoin Core without having to perform a single entry per private key within the console via `importprivkey`?  Can I use for example `importmulti` and specify a text file containing a list of these private keys? How can I do this? Or does anyone have a UNIX based script that can automate this process for me? Alternatively, is there a way to increase Electrum's synchronization time? Instead of pointing to the Electrum nodes/servers, can I point to an offline Blockchain DB?  


The reasoning why I'd like to import this wallet / private keys to Bitcoin Core is due to having downloaded Bitcoin core's offline Blockchain DB. My idea is that a Bitcoin-Qt (Bitcoin core) `rescan` will be faster than the never-ending synchronization I'm experiencing with the Electrum light wallet. I suppose the alternative may have to be running my own full node Electrum server on localhost and pointing Electrum to this RPC (this would download the entire blockchain and scan it for my own addresses) though I'm also uncertain if this would actually result in what I'm trying to achieve here, and so this would likely be last resort. I'm eager to know alternative opinions.  


My end goal; Importing 1000+ bitcoin private keys, and getting the wallet to hit 100% synchronization in the fastest way possible.  Thanks in advance."

1619564441,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is a bad long term investment. Change my mind.Hi all, I bought and sold some bitcoin in 2016/17 and made an excellent profit. I also recently reinvested (just a little) and I have been considering making a large purchase if there is a decent drop in price (I think/hope there will be soon). My concern is whether bitcoin is a good long term investment (post 2040) as I would be planning to hold the coin indefinitely. So if any knowledgeable redditors/economists are able to alleviate my 3 main concerns I would be grateful. This post is just my opinion, I'm not trying to influence yours. 

My first concern is the fact that the amount of bitcoins is finite. Eventually there will be very few bitcoins in circulation and this (imo) will lower the value. Around 2040 (or when the hype dies) fewer and fewer people will hold/use the asset (as many people will have used thier bitcoins to purchase things/cash in and be done with it) and then only a small group will own all the coin. There are also those who are planning to hold the coin indefinitely and not use it, which is also bad because bitcoin needs to be used to be valuable (transactions maintain the Blockchain right?). There are no ways to redistribute the coins (e.g taxes, creating more) so circulation will remain low, with a large portion of the coins being owned by the same people. I understand this could all change if there is a mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency, but even then the amount of coins would hinder the success and growth. But yeah the potential lack of circulation concerns me.  

Secondly the Blockchain is reliant on miners for upkeep but it will eventually not be very profitable to be a miner (from transactions alone- no more coins to mine). Especially if the amount of transactions slows and the miners fee lowers. No miners/fewer miners means a broken or slow transaction process and an inefficient system. Which again will lower/tank the price in the future. I mean bitcoin is completely dependent on the miners. 

Thirdly, Bitcoin is built on old technology that will almost certainly become redundant. This is a problem for 2 reasons: bitcoin will definitely be replaced by a superior technology (this is the way technology always works) and bitcoin/the Blockchain will be vulnerable to new security threats that imerge as technology improves. Maybe people will have some nostalgic love for the original crypto but surely the superior technology will be favoured. 

Anyways, I'm not trying to be a downer and I'm not necessarily saying bitcoin is a bad investment. I'm thinking long term though. So can someone with more knowledge put my mind at ease so I can invest with confidence. To me bitcoin is only good in the short term, please change my mind. Please also keep it civil, I'm not here to annoy people, I just don't want to make an uninformed decision. "

Services like banks, Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, etc, aggregate payments on top of fedwire, and they are starting to do the same on top of Bitcoin's monnetary system

When you put Dollars in your bank, you lose control of your dollars but you gain access to the payments aggregation: virtually free payments.

Mass adoption means that banks, Mastercard (ongoing), Paypal, etc, etc will start to aggregate payments on top of Bitcoin's monnetary system, keeping care of your funds and keys the same way they do with dollars.

This is the future, and refusing that path is equivalent to refuse mass adoption."

As I am 19 I'm aware the sooner I save and the more I save the better off I will be in the long run. However, in doing research in the fire movement and how it is basically storing all your wealth in a single index fund of all the companies of the world, I often wonder if that is really the best way to go. 

General question but If bitcoin is the ultimate store of wealth is there any advantage to investing a portion of my wealth in Stocks or mutual funds?

Seeing all the talks with buy this stock 'X', 100x stock 'Y', feels like a fair majority will get buggered by what will eventually come- So basically wondering if you folk still hold any equities: stocks, indices etc? or is it BTC maxi only?  


The more and more I read and look into the current climate and how long it has been like this, the less I want to be invested in a purely fed-driven market with one announcement away from catastrophe. I am young and in for long haul but have to say that BTC seems to be a much more attractive holding with the core fundamentals. Also open to any opinions for or against :)"

\-Buying assets like lumber can go towards the value of your home if you use it to build a deck or or stone if you use it to remodel your kitchen counter

1619653518,Bitcoin,"How market cap works, and the reason Bitcoin will DOUBLE in price overnight. (HODL)Earlier today I read Lyn Alden's article about how market caps and the price of an asset is set: ([https://www.lynalden.com/market-capitalization/](https://www.lynalden.com/market-capitalization/))

The tl;dr for the article, is that for a one trillion dollar asset to go to two trillion dollars, and by extension DOUBLE in price, an additional one trillion dollars of fiat does not need to flow in. It is possible that only 10B of fiat could flow in, and the price and market cap of Bitcoin could potentially *double*. The only thing that matters is the price that people are willing to sell, and the price which people are willing to buy.

What is going to take us to $100k+ in 2020 is likely to be a sharp move upwards, instead of a slow crawl like we have been experiencing.

How you might ask?

Suppose a traditional mega-corporation like Wal-Mart, a sovereign wealth fund, or a central bank in came out and announced that they now had a Bitcoin position. Almost immediately we would see a massive price appreciation which could be upwards of 100%.

Why is this? Well, within a few hours of the news, HODLers, would be instantly validated, feel like the Bitcoin prophecy is coming true, and would be unwilling to sell my own bitcoin for anything less than $100k/coin. 

Meanwhile, buyers, sensing that they are late to the party, and also feeling safer about taking a larger position now that X has purchased, would start to fomo in, and the notion they held just hours before of ""$50k is too expensive"" would be replaced by ""$100K is a good price!""

I know this sub talks about it alot, but you can view this as another reason why it is critically important to HODL your Bitcoin, and **not** trade in and out of it. The price appreciation will come sharply, and seemingly out of nowhere. You do not want to be in the middle of trading shitcoins when this white swan event inevitably happens."

If the actual announcement had been made, for example that they had $100M or $1B or whatever on their balance sheet, then no doubt it would have continued to go up even more.

What this means is, that if FB were to actually take a position, and then announce at earnings, they are almost guaranteed a nice return.  They could then sell if they wished, double down, whatever.  It is also highly likely that had they taken a position and announced, then other money, possibly even FAANG money would come in, making FB position even more attractive.

The reality is, this can happen to any company of size.  A household name, particularly a NASDAQ one with $1B position almost can’t go wrong.  What are they waiting for!"

1619648320,Bitcoin,"Evolution of bitcoin maximalistBack in 2015, I moved to another country, then I was 22 years old and I needed money.  That's when I first learned about bitcoin.  I created a wallet on blockchain.info and made my first purchase of bitcoins.  Since then I have bought bitcoins many times and never sold, this summer I plan to sell 5-10% of my bitcoins to buy a car.  Life has become much easier when you have bitcoins.

Here I want to describe my evolution from beginner to bitcoin maximalist:

1. Creating a custodial bitcoin wallet.
2. Registration on the exchange and purchase of the first bitcoins.
3. Buying shitcoins and unsuccessful trading.
4. Creating a cold wallet (electrum).
5. HODL.
6. Run the full node.
7. Explaining to your friends and relatives what bitcoin is.
8. Bitcoin mining (was not very successful considering the amount of time spent and bitcoins, in dollars it was quite profitable, because I did not sell the mined bitcoins)
9. Purchase a Trezor.
10. Regular monthly investments in bitcoin.

1619647293,Bitcoin,"Opinion on the decentralized internetI have been using such software as the Utopia ecosystem for quite some
Time.



Utopia is a breakthrough decentralized P2P ecosystem with no central server



involved in data transmission or storage.
 



https://u.is/en/
 



And just recently I began to stumble upon quite significant organizations
on which I read quite a lot of news about Utopia. I have never googled, as
I already use it and am happy about this issue. I look and grow in a very
right direction, I started using them when they were only advertised on
weak and unpretentious portals, no one took them seriously in any way.
 



So what am I talking about? Yes, so I decided to write my own review on
this matter, and discuss with knowledgeable guys how this can be and their
opinion to hear what they think. Just guys right away, let's
essentially, without this water, how many like to talk about how we are
always and everyone is bred, as a type of pseudo on us in quiet mining.
Let's think real ok? We are all always bred, deal with it. Nobody
quietly mines on your computers, because this is a nightmare as it is not
profitable and closed the topic.


 

So, how much I use, I constantly learn something new. Yes, there is a lot
of work, but the safety and integrity of the data is just at its best.
Quite often I play with fire, so to speak, but I publish provocative
information in general chats (you know, to check for lice) leaving bread
crumbs so that if I try, it would be possible to track who is doing what.
And you know? Damn I sleep well) And I am happy about it. So there are no
leaks. Well, yes, yes, yes, conspiracy books will say, like they are
waiting for larger fish, so let's not get confused here.
 



A separate topic for me is crypton. Well, how can I say separate? I just
notice a trend like Ethereum at the very beginning. Very similar (Not
programmatically), very fast transactions and convenient internal
integration (I did not try to withdraw, there is no such need), but the
guys have already managed to scoop and raise well-working exchangers inside
Utopia and some exchanges are already trading CRP. What about mining? Want
to mine or not. I personally, as much as I have used Utopia, have been
doing mining so much. I don't feel absolutely, I rent an average
server hand and everything is stable, even sometimes I forget that they are
(Well, there is no need to check and keep my finger on the pulse).
 



Of course, I can miss a lot, since in general I most likely pursue other
goals than most (Well, the miners probably understood). But I can say that
from the point of view of seeing the birth of the Internet again and how it
is moving in the right direction, this is an unforgettable experience. I
would say it's like plunging into the distant 2008. As sites, search engines and forums appear, people communicate in chats in



the same style as before, everyone shares new developments and
integrations, and how everyone rejoices when society creates something that
works. It's amazing.


 

Okay, this is the lyrics. Guys, let's share our impressions and



discuss everything we can? Just ask, let's have a constructive



discussion, rather than just pour from empty to empty, after all, we are an
adult and civilized society."

I just watched a video by Chico Crypto on BTC [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6\_0ssTfyL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6_0ssTfyL0) and from the 7:11 time stamp he speculates on Tesla's next evolution - the Tesla home Powerwall battery unit that might integrate with bitcoin miners so that mining becomes more green - utilising excess Tesla Powerwall power to mine that energy pig that is btc mining. Tesla and all EV cars etc are a long term play planning to supply EV for decades and decades to come. BTC mining will earn miners less and less so surely there will be a point in time (not too far away) that no-one bothers anymore.....

My question is - in relation to industry such as this, is it even realistic to include BTC mining?? Who is going to be mining BTC when they earn nothing for it"

Eventually they get so well connected and have the huge drug suppliers using Bitcoin as well (let’s not even get started on if they did this with terrorist organizations or other horribly illegal operations).

5 years down the line the police have records of every transaction ever done with these people and everything is permanently recorded on the Bitcoin network. Automatic convictions!

1619644084,Bitcoin,"How an address was generated ""back in the day""?I was wondering how one would generate public and private key, lets say before the year 2012? How do you think Satoshi did it?

I tried searching online, but did not find anything meaningful - everywhere same short intro about crypto followed by wallets tech...

Few things had changed, most importantly, the seed standard of BIP39 wasn't around...

Basically I'm asking:

Were people just picking a random amount of words and doing the algorithm to generate public and private keys? Were they using the same hash function (SHA256)? 
Did the process stayed the same i.e same random bytes input (whatever you preferred method of generating it, ex. like dice) gives same address output?"

1619642005,Bitcoin,"I sold all my crypto Feb 28Yeah you read that right. I sold every last sat, token, and shitcoin...but to understand why I did it I must first take you back to February 2nd. This was the first of my 2 surgeries during the month.

Surgery 1 consisted of repairing my deviated septum and a valve replacement ( not gonna lie here, this was probably from too much booger sugar from '03 to '13). Everything went great and the docs prescribed me hydrocodone for the pain. I laid around the house and tried to recover the best I could, but everyday as February 12th loomed closer my anxiety grew. I quit taking the painers on the 10th for a few reasons; my poop pains were getting worse than the nose pain, and I hate them. I grew up in a hollow in eastern KY were pain pills have destroyed more lives than I could even start to tell you about, but I digress.

Surgery 2, February 12 2021...Ulnar Nerve relocation in my right elbow, and the beginning of the end. If I could go back and never have this surgery I would. If I could just go back and not say the hydrocodone caused me shit pains I would give my left nut, because this doc switched me to oxycodone. I've had pain in my elbow since 2002 and I thought this would fix it. (And no it's not from pulling on my hang down...I go lefty with that) Full extension of my arm resulted in a terrible pain that surged down my arm into my fingers (as in shooting a basketball). Some people run in the morning...I get up at 5, walk the dogs, then get buckets.

So now I'm at home recovering from 2 surgeries and unable to do anything at work. My daily schedule is fucked up like a soup sandwich, and my sleep schedule is not existent. On Feb 14th my port hit its ATH and the euphoria from that multiplied by painers and the double dose anesthesia had me on another planet. I began looking at my phone for hours on end but didn't notice at the time. The insomnia was not too far behind. I was waking up at all hours of the night and just walking around the house. I was generally waking up around 3:33 to 3:43 and looking at my port. The weekend of February 28th my fiance had a girl's trip. I guess I woke up around the same time and I sold it all. Everything on [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/), everything on NEXO, everything on Coinbase. I try to remember it, I try to ask myself why. I lost thousands just from selling on Coinbase alone, and the thing is I'm no noob. I've been in crypto since August '17 and yes I got rekt as fuck in '18 but I learned many valuable lessons. In 2019 I started buying up small amounts of alt coins any chance I could to hodl for this moment we find ourselves in now. I was also able to accumulate .7 BTC that I was never going to sell but give to my daughter one day. I had a portfolio that I 100% believe would have netted me 1 million dollars this year...and when you have only brought home 14k in the last 2 years that could really change your life.

Did I panic sell? I'll let you be the judge to that. When my fiance came home later that day she said I was happier than a pig in shit. I told her I sold it all...and honestly she didn't care one way or the other because I still can't get her to understand the importance of crypto and blockchain technologies. But for me this is when the fun started, because you remember those painers I was on? Well I quit taking them the 26th. I had basically been on pain pills for 3 out of the 4 weeks in the month. I did not realize I was in the middle of withdrawals. The cold sweats came and went, the panic attacks started, the realization that I had completely fucked my future and wasted the last 4 years preparing for this once in a life time moment only to throw it away. The biggest mistake was sending my money to my bank account..once again proving I was out of my fucking mind. I've lived on less than $200 in my account for years. The bank held it up for days and my panic grew and grew. I needed to get back in the market.

I was unable to sleep more than an hour at a time and I knew I had to get some help. I was not making any rational sense about anything and none of the people around me could understand why I was reacting like this. They didn't understand the consequences to my actions. I mean how could they? None of them were in crypto, but it wasn't from my lack of trying. I was able to get a small portion back in around March 6th but the damage was done and I still didn't have access to all my funds. By the 8th I checked myself in somewhere just to get some rest. They loaded me up and said I could get out the next day, which turned out to be a lie. I underwent evaluation after evaluation. None of these people could understand either. I just wanted to get home and save what I could of my port. Eventually after 2 days there they sent me home with trazadone, hydroxizine, and seroquel.

Jesus Christ that shit did not help. Yes it helped me fall asleep but It would place me in a nightmare reliving the moment where I realized I sold it all. I would wake up to more anxiety than I went to bed with and the night sweats were on another level. Now we are 2 months removed from that fateful night but I still have to live with it everyday. I have taken myself off all the damn meds and just trying to come to terms with it still. Yes I still have some skin in the game but not even half of what it was. I had planned on converting most of my altcoins into ZEC while it was still under $200 from my original port because lets be honest it's going to melt faces soon.

And this part is for you...While all this was going on I was also trying to come to terms with some shit that happened to me as a kid. So I started making a cartoon with a friend of mine and the first episode if available below. (Here's a hint, it involves my teacher)

I go home and see someone logged into my email and reset the password. They also tried resetting my Coinbase password too. Now I am like great I am getting hacked. I lock down my email and lock down my Coinbase account.

Turns out the only thing that saved me was my 2FA app like Google authenticator. I have heard the stories about people getting their phone number stolen but I never thought it would happen to me.

A little back story: I don't usually leave it on the exchange but I am getting a different hardware wallet and sell a little. I don't like keeping my money on the exchange because like everyone here says if you don't hold the keys it is not your crypto.

I read online, as well as youtube, that many people believe that this is the alt coin season for a few months, money flow from bitcoin to alt coins which would cause bitcoin dominance to decrease and altcoin price to booming(look at ETH). However, Bitcoin price will somehow stay at this level. 

Meanwhile, it seems no one is worried if bitcoin price will plummet as money leaves bitcoin....Now the BTC. D is below 50%. Last time this happened was Jan 2018. Also, Jan 2018, ETH is unhook from BTC price, just like now... 

Am I missing anything? Why do you think this bitcoin dominance fall is not a warning sign/big deal, which implys the market big crash?"

I’m wondering what experienced people have to say about it? And maybe are there other sites with good trackable charts that are reliable? 

Also, I’m wondering if buys on Coinbase actually impact the price movement on Bitcoin as opposed to coins just being moved off the exchange into cold storage?  In other words, since I don’t own the coins on Robinhood or Coinbase, do my buys and sells actually have any impact on what occurs, or does the price movement on Bitcoin only rely on the physical coin being put on and/or removed from the exchange into a physical hard wallet?

1619816543,Bitcoin,"Multisig address creation with CasaHello fellow Bitcoiners. I'm contemplating signing up for Casa's gold plan and using a 2-of-3 multisig address to store my bitcoin. I don't feel secure with the default setup whereby one of my private keys is stored on the Casa app because I cannot independently verify that it is impossible for Casa to obtain that software key (either now or with a future app software update). 

As such, I'm considering the setup whereby my two private keys are stored on separate hardware wallets, with Casa holding the third private key. I'm asking for help from r/bitcoin in understanding how exactly the multisig address is created. 

Casa will generate the 2-of-3 multisig address on their end. In order to generate the multisig address, Casa will combine each of the three public keys (two public keys provided by me and one public key provided by Casa). The two public keys will be provided by me, specifically by plugging in each of my hardware wallets. More specifically, my hardware wallets will use their private keys (which never leave my hardware wallets) to generate the public key. In other words, is it at all possible that, in the process of Casa generating the 2-of-3 multisig address with all three public keys, Casa can access my two private keys?

Is anything I said incorrect? I'm trying to eliminate all forms of trust here, so any help is appreciated!"

1619816004,Bitcoin,"Don't lose sight of your ""WHY"" in cryptoDon't lose sight of your ""WHY"" in crypto. We all started the crypto journey for different reasons, whether it's to save for retirement, pay of debt, save for kids college funds and such. It's the ""WHY"" that makes us human in crypto. 

Those who have been to my zooms are probably tired of hearing me say this all the time but I see it as my personal mission to help people not forget their WHY in crypto. 

Throughout my crypto journey, I've come across many people who have lost sight of their ""WHY"" and end up being 'crypto zombies'. These zombies may be able great at charting and can predict the price of BTC a week from now right to the dot, they can recite to you Satoshi paper but their life is a mess as all they care about is chasing after the next 0. Their family doesn't respect them, their health is horrible, they're stressed out most of the day and little are they aware, they're just slaves to crypto.  
Ask yourself if this the life you want? Is your life headed towards becoming a zombie? 

It's not too late to turn back. Refocus your eyes on your WHY and go at it. Its ok if you're not selling at the absolute top, as long as you have some gains and the gains is able to make a difference (eg. paying off student loans or take a year break from work), be happy you're part of the crypto journey. This is especially for those who have already achieved their WHY already. 

Enjoy the present, spend some time with people around you (and try not to mention a single word of crypto), take some profit and be generous with it. (Even if your why is to be free from government control, take some time to enjoy being human) 

What good is it to make a lot in crypto but lose your life and humanity in the process. There's more to life than crypto.

Feel free to share your WHY in the comments below."
1619815861,Bitcoin,"My 2 satoshis pt. 3, or I love when a plan comes together.Following my 2 previous posts, let me conclude with a simple trading strategy. I now many of you are investing and, having read my first post, know that trading is another game and involves a few other instruments. Nothing against investing, if that is your choice, I'm just pointing a fork is not the best tool to eat soup. 

Nevertheless, let me point out that a ""buy low, sell high"" approach is not a strategy but a purpose and, as I suspect is obvious by now, makes as many sense as saying the teams strategy for the next game will be ""to stop losing"". So, considering you already know about R:R ratios, let me introduce you to a few concepts before I explain the simplest strategy I could think of. 

1 - When to get out

As I said before, If you don't know when to enter and to close your position, you are gambling and, by now, I suppose I don't need to point to you the only two possible outcomes to your trade. If the market moves the way you want, you should know when to take your profit and, if it does not, when to stop you loss. Take profits and stop losses are numbers. They are not concepts or actions you will take if someday, by any chance, something happens. You need to have the exact asset's value BEFORE you open your position. If you are planning to put on your seatbelt in the eventuality of an accident, I have bad news for you. On the other hand, by ditching your date because you could be banging someone else you may get lucky, but there is a risk you'll be going home alone. 

2 - When (and if) to get in 

Now that you know when you will get out, you need to find an opportunity to get in and calculate de risk/reward ratio to see if it is worth it. If the opportunity doesn't show or if there is not enough possible profit for the risk you are about to take, do not enter. You are not losing by not entering, but you may lose a lot by entering  against the rules. 

To make things easy, I'll be visual. I'm using tradingview, a free tool to follow and analyze stock and crypto markets. The strategy I'm showing is a crossing of two moving averages, meaning a long term average (I'll call slow) and a short term average (I'll call fast) will give a visual representation of the trend. For this, I'm using EMAs (exponential moving averages) of the last 20 and 50 closes. Yes, you may use other values and other tools, I won't argue about that and my choice is purely didactic. 

&amp;#x200B;

[EMA cross strategy](https://preview.redd.it/ue7g7mbqfdw61.jpg?width=1077&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4863dd4f21f89ed23adffbe517c1614310820c6f)

The rules are simple: If the fast average crosses above the slow, you buy. When the fast crosses below the slow, you sell. You could also use the candle close crossing of the slow as a rule, but let's take one step at time. What about the stop loss and take profit? For those, I'll use the last highest high (top) and the closing of the candle below the slow average. Again: when the price hits the last top, I'll close my position with profit; If a candle closes below the slow average, I'll stop my losses. Alternatively, my stop loss could be a close below the lowest low, or below the fast average, or x% below the last candle. The important part is to create a rule and STICK to it. Knowing my entry point, stop loss and take profit, I may now calculate my R:R. As stated before, I never enter a trade below 1:3, meaning my profit must be at least 3 times what I would lose in a stop loss.

&amp;#x200B;

[EMA cross with entry point and take profit](https://preview.redd.it/jdmpxe41hdw61.jpg?width=844&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f80d6f9e210bf33b65d0e72928093d0d869f9b1)

In the image above, the red arrow shows the entry point and the yellow line the take profit. Opening a position you would know the entry price, the stop loss and the take profit. A few candles before the arrow you would have an entry using the rule for closing above the slow average.  

No, this is not a good strategy and will not survive a backtesting, but I'm showing it so you may understand what to look for. This is extremely simple and needs another confirmation to work, such as a MACD crossing. I don't think it will be a surprise, but people don't usually share good strategies. 

There is a lot to learn, and even more good books about it. Most of what I covered in those 3 posts are in Alexander Elder's ""Trading for a living"". It's an old book and the strategies should not be followed blindly, but it's a great source of information."

1619814494,Bitcoin,"The same posts all the timeI am really really new to Bitcoin and crypto, but I do my own research and ask specific technical questions when I need to to understand things.

But jeez...the number of posts recently that ask questions like “should I invest in crypto now or is it just about to dip again?” Or “when is the right time to invest in bitcoin? Will it drop soon? Should I buy then?” I really despair. 

I’m not like a protective fanboy that doesn’t want fake people to like their band, but honestly, the number of times these questions are asked I just feel like saying:

“If you don’t understand it, don’t get involved. It’s not a get rich quick scheme. It’s investment. It’s a belief in the technology and the implications of what that means. It is much bigger and deeper than buying APPL stock. There is no “time” to buy bitcoin, it’s a choice and a commitment you have to how we should structure our economic life. Or whatever, buy next Tuesday because it’s going to dip.” 🙄"

Anyways, flash forward to today when BTC is doing quite well, as we all know. But it occurred to me that transferring that to him back them triggered tax implications I wasn't focused on. Honestly I wasn't focused on much beyond ""You took my BTC! BTC I bought in the hopes it could put our kids through school one day! BTC I bought that you just laughed at!""

Well I've gotten over the loss by now, but  wondering how to address tax stuff. Thoughts? Resources or advice would be super helpful. And even more so, is bitcoin joint property within a marriage? Is a private key common property? Just so many aspects to this that I didn't think about back then."

1619915043,Bitcoin,"Talk me out of (or into) doing a VA Cash Out on my mortgage and putting into BTCI have a VA mortgage.

VA has a program called Cash Out which allows you to Cash Out 100% of the value of your home (minus what you owe).  This is a pretty remarkable concept, as typically the best you can do on a traditional loan is 80%.  Fee is about 2.5% of the total loan.

VA Interest rates are about 2.6% or so right now (30 year)

I owe about 13 years on my mortgage.

Market is at All Time High (Housing Market) and I believe its going to correct/go down, it has too, but right now I can basically pull a substantial amount of equity into cash at a very low rate.  My mortgage payment would actually reduce.

Thought is, pull out a nice huge sum of money, invest in crypto, continue to pay mortgage and profit huge on the gains over time (5y, 10y, 20y, 30y).  I could even choose to sell at some point some of my position and just pay off the loan (If I would have done this earlier this year, I would already have enough in just ""months"" to pay off the entire loan, and own my house outright).

I plan to do this.  I am looking for agreeing or opposing viewpoints to make sure I have done all the critical thinking that needs to be done here."

1619912637,Bitcoin,"PoW vs PoSStill a little confused about the difference here.

PoW is very easy to understand. Miners guess the nonce that results in the correct hashed result. The one who guessed right (ie. Proof of work) gets the block reward. The downside is that everyone trying to guess at the same time, wasting a lot of energy.

PoS as I understand, lets miners who stake high amount of coins try and guess ""high value"" blocks which means higher rewards? Would this mean that if I'm mining eth, I have to input the amount of eth I'd like to stake, before I get ""assigned a block"" and start going to work on guessing the nonce? Where is the ""proof"" in this case? And why would this save more energy? Regardless of who mines which block, the energy needed to guess a nonce shouldn't change?
And if miners who are more ""rich"" get right to better blocks/rewards, wouldn't this create a ""rich get richer"" situation?

Can someone who uses or used to use Robinhood for trading Bitcoin please explain why my limit orders barely ever get filled regardless if they are above the market price for a pretty significant amount of time?

Throughout the day I trade BTC for some slight pocket cash here and there, I'm treading lightly because it feels like an implosion is bound to happen sometime soon. Keeping my risk very low here, I will buy and sell within a max of 25/30 minutes.

My limit orders barely ever fill, even if there's a significant drop in the market price and it's below my limit. On that note, market orders are consistently filled above the market price even when that price holds for let's say 2/3 minutes before to 2/3 minutes after. I'm undershooting here because I'd prefer to not go overboard with the time brackets, my latest example being that I purchased a small amount of BTC which filled at ?$55? above a market price that held for like 5 minutes.

You will get payment information “ Gift Visas are registered with Visa online with more information if used. Bank Accounts are registered as payment methods for websites if Pay Pal they also have registered payment information to named banks. With information documented. This means that whoever stole it has an internet trail. To some form of payment method meaning information as to the person who created it. The top five companies for purchasing Domains have this info including Google at the top to the Company addresses as domains with real payment info. 

Third make a payment for the authority’s as a reward for hunting them down as a group. Because it’s millions of dollars. Because they will be hunting them rewards will be high. 

They will be able with the bank accounts information from the payment made for the domains or PayPal as I’m sure they love catching fraud in the terms it was written they have the right to change them at anytime for there own purpose meaning handing the information to authority’s is no problem. Time of course for proof of police station or officer status. The background check for there sin numbers or birth records comes up with addresses for there taxes each year as it has to be know for taxes to be returned. Banks have this along with governments.

After a few months every fraud case can come to full resolution with the support of Google or domain information “odd if not Google”. Microsoft will as Bill “dislikes Crypto 🤨” after the fraud companies information has been found leading to a person. PayPal for the secondary account with saved information in there servers for 5 to 10 years if closed after. In PayPal this is a bank for the .10 cent setup at the start. They have it.

1620003368,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Gift Tax Question (Form 709)I've had Bitcoin since 2017. In late-2020 I heard about BlockFi and tried to create an interest-bearing account but was unable to due to living in NY. I had sent my brother (who lives in NJ) $20k worth of Bitcoin, which is now worth much more, and he put it into his BlockFi account to earn interest. I didn't know about needing to report Gift Taxes (Form 709). 


My question is, when it comes to gift taxes, is my brother able to return the Bitcoin to me in full in the future (by filing another gift tax form)? Or is this some sort of irreversible tax situation? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you so much!"

1620002914,Bitcoin,"What is the origin story of a single unit of Bitcoin being set equal to 100M sats?My understanding and from what I can tell, the core code only ever uses an integer (long) for the values of coins in tx's; never deals with doubles/floats or scaled floats. This base unit eventually became known as a satoshi or sat.

But when and why did 100 million of these base units become known as a single unit for Bitcoin. I'm interested in both technical and banter of the origin story that became the infamous single unit of a Bitcoin. 

A naive assumption I've arrived at is that it may have something to do with the max value of a 32 bit signed integer (2,147,483,647 = [231-1]). Probably just a coincidence, but this max value is 100 times the 21 million bitcoin limit we always hear about."

1619995612,Bitcoin,"Why is BTC still top 1?I'm new to cryptocurrency, but i have already found that BCH has two main differences from BTC, that make it a complete cash/gold digital system, without needing second layers or soft-forks, such as taproot or lightning network.

These differences are block size and replace by fee mechanism.

&amp;#x200B;

As everyone here knows, BCH can store 8 times more transactions per block than BTC. The less transactions in queue the less miner fees.

The current fees differences are US$30,00 per BTC transaction, against US$0,007 per BCH transaction.

&amp;#x200B;

I know, fees aren't the only one barrier against crypto escalability, there's also the confirmation time. BTC tries to achieve instant transactions by creating  LN channels (after 10 minutes on average). It works fine, but it's acts like a second layer, and need's an additional effort to completely implement, and make everyone use

&amp;#x200B;

Once BCH transactions never can be replaced, BCH can achieve the same instant  transactions, just by send your transaction to the network. If at least the seller (who you sent your money) holds your transactions in his's own mempool, then it's safe to say that it's impossible to not have this transaction confirmed.

This cannot occures in BTC, once you can easily replace the transaction by one with a higher fee and a different output (like yourself). 

&amp;#x200B;

that said, i ask, why is BTC still top 1?

This is a longer writeup with a few big references, read this when you have 5 minutes to spare.

Cryonics is the practice of vitrifying sick patients with the hope of reviving them when practical treatments for their ailments become available. This is a field that has many parallels to Bitcoin, as I will try to explain next.

### Similarities

* Both fields require far sightedness. Bitcoin was an uncertain new technology that required a lot of luck and foresight in its early adopters. Small mistakes may lead to catastrophic losses, or at least compound over time. Similarly, today, a viable brain has never been revived from liquid nitrogen temperatures, although there have been demonstrations of small cells and animal organs, with increasing progress. It is unclear when or if revival will ever become viable, we can only speculate based on current science. Cryonicists today often use it as a last resort so their life isn't really at risk, however, they do risk losing their time (often a tremendous amount) and significant sums money on an unproven treatment.

* Both fields are hard to understand in their entirety because of the complex interconnection of ideas. In understanding Bitcoin, we are taken on a ride through many disciplines - computer science, cypherpunk culture, decentralized and peer-to-peer protocols, cryptography, game theory, incentives and mechanism design, the nature of money and banking, political economy, even carnivory(?), transhumanism/biohacking and more. Similarly, cryonics requires a deep understanding of low temperature physics, (low temperature) cryobiology, neuroscience, perfusion/ischemia, death and related law/finance, nano-technology, transhumanism, even religion and societal changes over long time spans. Quite a few early pioneers and current Bitcoin contributors straddle both fields - notably Hal Finney, Ralph Merkle, and a few others I won’t name here.

* The advocates/adherents of both fields have similar characteristics, from fanatical cores to toxic advocates, even scammers.

* The adherents of both fields have never ending ""technology first"" vs ""adoption first"" debates. Should we focus on developing the technology and proving the viability of new techniques, or try to get more users/members?

* Both fields are not only widely misunderstood, but suffer from misinformation/FUD and have collected a lot of enemies over time. Bitcoin's proof of work being wasteful, inefficient decentralization, usage by criminals, threat to nation states, etc have been used to diminish its significance and adoption. Cryonics have been labeled a pseudo-science, scam and pipe dream. From the Wikipedia article on Cryonics, ""The Society for Cryobiology have rejected as members those who practiced cryonics, and have issued a public statement saying that cryonics is ""not science"".

* Both fields present participants with highly asymmetric payoffs. When Bitcoin moons, the price action transforms future potential into a high price in the present. If cryonics works, you get revived! You get to live! You may literally go to the moon in person yourself (assuming space transport becomes routine). Unfortunately, this feedback (when it comes) is less immediate. Again, this is a field where foresight is important.

### Dissimilarities

The two fields are not always similar of course. Cryonics is much older and mostly already (heavily?) regulated. It is less amenable to DIY hacking, hopefully bio-hackers can help make the whole field (not just cryonics) more approachable to everyone. Cryonics has fewer ""casual"" cryonicists and have not achieved ""mass adoption"". There are fewer ""intellectuals"" or philosopher crynicists although there are many good original thinkers too.

Response to crises - Bitcoin has shrugged off many crises. However, the closest analogy to the Mt Gox moment in cryonics might have been the Chatsworth incident. There have been many other notable events since but not as many as in Bitcoin.

I got stuck dividing 21 millions coins against 8 billion people so everyone should have 0.0026

But if top 1% owns 50% of the wealth then that means 10.5 million coins for 80 million people

So is top 1% of the top 1% 5.25 million coins for 800k people meaning 6.56 Bitcoin?

P.S. then “top 1% of the top 1% of the top 1%” is essentially 2.625 million coins for 8k people meaning 328 bitcoin"

However, monetary transactions have a long-disputed history concerning their origin.

Throughout our civilisation, we have read that the barter system was used as a means of a transaction; however, with size, scope, and measure of transactions increasing, the barter system was inadequate and, subsequently, unreliable as the scope of goods transacted increased. It became difficult to ascertain the actual barter value of each product, leading to a uniform, widely accepted mechanism to conduct trade and commerce."

I've not worked first-hand with crypto before. I work in IT, so I've been paying attention to it and blockchain, and given the discussions around scams and risk, I am being deathly careful.

I believe I have an 8 digit public key, and a 33 digit private key. I'm not sure what steps I need to follow to get the funds into my ZenGo wallet. I thought there would be an add funds or receive or redeem option within the wallet app, but the only receive options seem to be to share my wallet address or use a QR code.

I dived into BTC in 2016, but sadly because of a big financial crisis I took everything out in 2018.

Last year it caught my attention again. Obviously because of the bull run and because more people around me are seriously getting into it. It can't be ignored anymore. I don't regret getting out, because I believe today you're still early.

Things are going better now, financially, and I'm going back in again. I won't get out anymore, no matter what and HODL for my children on their own hardware wallets. 

Reason why I share this, is to make it real for myself. To encourage myself to do it again. To do it for myself and my children. They are the future, just like I believe bitcoin is.

Thank you all for sharing your stories, encouragement, insights and everything else. It helped me making this decision."

1620167716,Bitcoin,"How can Bitcoin scale with limited block size?I heard to scale through function as settlement layer not for every small transaction. I think this is done through 2 layer like Coinbase which just cache the transaction and only do a “settlement “ like once per day.  However to build and maintain a second layer of centralized layer of transaction seems a bad practice. For Coinbase as an example , seems each account do have unique wallet addresses , that feels like individual transactions are still done at block chain. Can anyone help on my confusion about this?"

There is a new scam that is going around. I own a shopify store online and was looking to sell it for what it was worth at the time for $15,000.00 and listed is for sale through the shopify exchange app which was legitimate. A buyer named Thomas Leigh from the UK then reached out to me saying he was interested in purchasing my website however he has reached his purchase limit on the exchange and that he was willing to pay me in BTC through an exchange of his choice through an internal deposit and all I had to do was create an account. I reluctantly agreed after he reassured me that I would not have to transfer over any of the assets until I was able to withdraw the money first to my bank and verify the funds. I signed up and created an account for the website on [dexy.exchange](https://dexy.exchange) and they perform normal security precautions as any exchange should asking for legitimate ID etc. I send him my internal wallet address on Dexy and he sends me 0.022 BTC the agreed upon amount. After I try to withdraw the platform says that I need to make a small deposit to withdraw those funds as a  KYC was required and to do the KYC the exchange said to deposit 0.025 bitcoin which I unfortunately did. The exchange then says that I need a premium account to withdraw this large amount and that I must now make a deposit of 0.05 bitcoin which then confirmed the scam even further. I was so stupid, but at the time I was just really excited and wasn't thinking clearly. I message Thomas inquiring about these deposits and he seemed so real and genuine and it had felt like we had built a real friendship and he says do not worry, I will find a way to send you the 0.05 btc for you to send to the platform, but then I was like "" why didnt you just send it to my external wallet in the first place?' Anyways, time goes by and he stops responding and after a week he says he has fallen ill and is in the hospital at the moment and will schedule a video call to find a solution to this and that he is embarrassed things have turned out like this. another week goes by and his wife messages me from his email saying he has now passed away with her fake email story and then stopped replying and has even told me to hold onto the money for now and that she needs to spend time with her family and will be in contact with me lol which is a lie. This happed over a period of 1 month, and the website looks extremely legitimate and they are so good at working together BEWARE OF [dexy.exchange](https://dexy.exchange) , the have a real address and real registered company on their website but they are a scamm!!!"

1620164401,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin's 4yr Performance Analysis vs. ShitcoinsWhile I am a new Bitcoiner, I've been concerned with the recent ""under performance"" vs. shitcoins.  Not even against the doggy coin, but mostly with the #2 which is a more legitimate contender for crypto dominance.  I'll just call it #2 to avoid Bot deleting.

After trying to educate myself this afternoon and reviewing price performance of Bitcoin vs. #2 for the last 4 years, I have a few conclusions:

* The 2016-2018 bull run and subsequent bear market feel very similar to what is forming right now related to Bitcoin vs. #2 price performance.
* During the final phase of the last bull run, #2 outperformed Bitcoin between Dec 2017 - Feb 2018, both with stronger growth and lighter declines during the price swings for that 3 month period.  Between 12/18/17 through roughly 2/20/18, BTC declined by -40% while #2 grew +18%.  A very similar divergence to what we are seeing right now.  I'm sure Bitcoiners felt like it was ""the end"" during that time period.
* Later in 2018 during the rock bottom of the bear market (Dec 2018), #2 declined harder than BTC to end 2018 (-92% decline vs. BTC's -73% decline)
* Bitcoin growth outpaced #2 for the next two years between Dec 2018 - Feb 2021, including the start of the current bull market and counting the Tesla announcement for BTC in February of this year.
* However, #2 is obviously outperforming BTC over the last 2 months.  Comparing CURRENT prices vs. the 2017 top, #2 has seen stronger growth - ONLY if you include the last 2 months.
* Again, the last 2 months feel very similar to the divergence we saw between 12/17 - 2/18 where BTC consolidated and #2 observed growth.
* What followed after that period was BTC regaining momentum and ""market share""

My conclusion is that we've seen this type of activity before, where the next best shitcoin has a temporary period of strong growth relative to BTC.  What follows is a harder decline, followed by strong BTC growth - especially fueled by institutional FOMO with BTC as we saw in Feb 2021 with Tesla.  

I expect the tide to swing back to BTC in the coming months, especially if we see more Fortune 500 Treasury announcements later in the year like we are all hoping/expecting.  Remember boys and girls, those are much more likely to flow into BTC vs. any other shitcoin.  As soon as the next major company buys BTC, the tide will change within hours.

This is for any active traders who have an edge (or got lucky) that helped them get in to this bull run early and have held a sizeable leveraged long BTC position for much or even most of the current bull run.  If there are any who have been so fortunate who want to talk about it at all (maybe there aren't)!

By long term I mean at least a few months, or let's just say since BTC was less than 50% or so of what it is now. By leveraged position I mean at least 2x leverage on the typical perpetual swap as on Binance, BitMEX, FTX, etc.

I'm wondering how severe the funding fees have been on perpetuals in the aggregate (trying to calculate it myself with hypothetical positions based on reported funding fee data on various exchanges).  Have the funding fees you've paid overall been tiny compared to your unrealized gains?

Whether you had a systematic edge that you followed the rules for to get you into your position or you got lucky, was the experience gut wrenching for a while at first in that your stop/liquidation was super close to being hit and yet ultimately wasn't?  Was it a nightmare until the price really got up away from your stop/liquidation price?

I find it incredible that some people can figure out how to use leverage with directional positions and do it successfully long term without blowing up."

1620256426,Bitcoin,"PSA: the actions of binance are best explained by insolvencyThis is a **red alert to all bitcoin holders not to use the binance exchange**. You can assess the facts yourself by going to the r/binance subreddit, and seeing all the support requests for locked accounts. If you look for a pattern, you will notice that accounts trying to transfer money *out* are locked down, and nobody trying to transfer money in.

A convenience sample:

* https://old.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/n4i0yr/weekly_binance_support_thread/
* https://old.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/n5subl/hello_i_have_been_trying_to_contact_your_services/

* https://old.reddit.com/r/binance/comments/n5q5nt/cz_admitting_on_twitter_that_binance_has_issues/

Those are the facts. I don't have any additional information about binance, and can't make a statement of fact without putting myself at risk of libel. However, the best possible explanation to fully explain their actions is that **binance is insolvent, and should be treated as such**. 

It pains me greatly to say it, because I need your deposits to achieve my own withdrawals, but I can't in good conscience be silent about this.

If it adds anything to my credibility, I am a MtGox survivor, and managed to get my funds out just in time back then. In large part due to listening to warning like this one.

With something like Metamask or a future more useful equivalent you won't need a Stripe service to incorporate payments.

Stripe is useful for chargebacks and fraud. This might be a service that can be provided by a smart contract validator or an abstract layer of meta smart contracts which takes care of frauds.

How then will Stripe survive in a world where Visa, Mastercard and traditional banks are no longer here?"

1620253407,Bitcoin,"Mine bitcoin to save the rainforest?I have two 3090s in a server that are often idle. I don't like the idea of mining bitcoin, as it's bad for the enviroment. But what about mining, then donating the money to a charity (Cool Earth)?

3090s use 250W + 250W = 12 kWh/day.

Make about $20 USD in bitcoin/day together.

12kWh is about 12kg of CO2 released (directly) if it comes from burning coal. ([https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&amp;t=11))

Donate the bitcoin (or Ethereum) to Cool Earth, they accept crytocurrencies.

""We estimate that Cool Earth is able to reduce emissions by 1 tonne of CO2-equivalent for every $1.34 donated, for directly protected forest specifically (although this figure may be as low as $0.65). If a indirectly shielded forest is also included, this drops to $0.38 per tonne of CO2-equivalent.""

Burn 12kg of CO2 (let's say 24kg to include other externalities), prevent 14900 (20/1.34) kg of emissions. Factor of 620x. Even if their estimate is wrong by 100x, it still seems to make sense.

1620248039,Bitcoin,"Opportunity or trouble?I've been playing in BTC for a few months, DCA as best as possible, in for the long-term. But I'm in my early 40s so ""long-term"" for me makes sense.
But at what age does it NOT make sense for someone to buy? For instance, my father is in his 70's, relatively good health, and has a bit of money he's looking to diversify. We had talked about buying real estate together for rental income but the current market is prohibitive. 
What's the best strategy for older folks who don't have time to long-term HODL, but still want to earn a bit while they have time to enjoy it, and maybe throw a little profit towards a bucket list item?

My dad suggested he give me x amount to invest as I choose, and then in a year or three, he'd like 1.5x in return and if there's extra I get to keep it. The caveat is that if it falls (which it obviously will), I have to repay him 0.8x however I can. Now, if I had 15 years (which I *personally* hope to have) this is a no-brainer. But HE doesn't have 15 years. And I have ZERO interest in day trading. I don't know what ""shorting"" is. I couldn't fathom setting up a node. I barely know what staking is but am learning more every day and trying to figure out how with what I have and how it would change with my dad's investment.

So I guess I'm looking for a discussion with multiple prongs here:
When does age become a factor to the benefits of HODL?
Our aging population is a large demographic. Is this specific barrier a concern for adoption rates?  
For those who want to diversify and safeguard (and let's not pretend here) profit, but don't have the luxury of time, are there good mid-term options?
What would be the best way to invest this x amount of money with the goal of paying him back but also having something left for me to HODL longer? 

I know that Time in the market is better than Timing the market, but in order for x to reach fullest potential, it needs to go in sooner than later, right? Because that would increase the time IN the market? Knowing time is a limiting factor, is dividing x into weekly DCA still the best suggestion?

I'm leaning towards taking his offer. I don't want to be told what to do on reddit. I'm just looking for a discussion regarding concerns many of us may have to deal with as our parents start hearing more about crypto and wondering if it's too late for them to benefit, and something to consider when challenging traditional banks and assets."

If you asked them 2 years ago ""hey if one day the fed randomly decided to print 10 trillion dollars, that would cause hyperinflation, right"" everyone would agree. But when it actually happens, 90% of people come up with some excuse as to why nah not.......nah not hyperinflation that can't happen here. 

&amp;#x200B;

In drugs, its called the **onset** when you take a pill and wait for it to kick it. During the onset you feel 0 effects. The onset lasted from maybe March 2020 to Jan 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Next is the **come up,**  when you start to feel effects but its not full strength yet. The come up started once the vaccine rolled out and people started spending, inflation starts small. The come up started Jan 2021 once the vaccine started allowing poeple to leave their house.

&amp;#x200B;

After the come up is the **Peak** \- I except the peak start once we reach 80% to100% vaccination in the USA, we are currently at about 33% vaccinated. Current estimates say it will take until 2022 to get their.

&amp;#x200B;

The **come down,** come as the fed raises rates. Hyperinflation is only temporary, as it only last a few years in every country in history. But your savings will be worthless by the time of the come down."

I always told myself if it ever went that low I'd buy as much as I could. So, the time came, but I realised coinbase pro had updated their trading fees. They seemed pretty high considering coinbase pro (or GDAX as it was called then) was free to trade on when I joined. So I decided to sign up to binance instead, which had much lower fees. However, when I tried to sign up, their website verification wouldn't work properly. I emailed them back and forth a few times about it to try and get it working, but didnt get anywhere with it. By then the price had gone back up a good bit, and I was pretty peeved off about the whole thing. Combined with stress from work I just let it be for a while but never got back to it. 

I feel like an idiot for not just paying the higher fees on coinbase at the time. I was intending to buy around 5BTC at the time, which by now would be a life changing sum of money.

I know I should be happy with what I've got, but I'm finding it difficult to get over the whole thing. I know people talk about regretting not buying when it was cheap, but this event in particular really gets to me, because I actually tried to and would be set for life now if only binance's website had worked properly!

Anyone had a similar experience or have tips for me to stop being salty about this?"

How does this community envision a government financing itself if it cannot create and manage its own currency? Ex. how does Congress raise money to pay engineers to build a bridge if currency is sovereign from government?



It is hard for me to imagine a political system other than anarchy where decentralized currency is dominant. Ex. most economists believe liberalism and democracy are codependent - where does Bitcoin fit within liberalism? And if it doesn't fit within liberalism, what replaces it?


Alternatively, do most bitcoiners see it as more of a ""store of value"" like gold? And not expect it to function as a significant part of global financial systems? 

Would it be possible for a possible for a future fiat currency to be backed by Bitcoin or any Crypto?  

How do you interpret ""Govcoins""?"

Recently, I made 3 separate transactions, 2 of which were successful. All 3 transactions were Bitcoin purchases on cashapp, then withdrawals to a Bitcoin wallet on Bitmart exchange. The series went as follows:

Transaction #1: $100 received in Bitmart within 2 hours

Transaction #2: $250 not received

Transaction #3: $100 received in Bitmart within 1 hour.

The $250 transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain for weeks now, via a cashapp web receipt. Bitmart's customer service, which is literally useless, has confirmed via the TXID that they see the transaction; no errors have been made on my end.

So my question is, now what? It's been over two weeks, the transaction was completed correctly, and my money is nowhere to be found. Should i expect this to reach the wallet eventually? Is there a tool to reverse the transaction? Or am I SOL?

Any feedback is helpful. Thanks."

Seems like a bogus argument.

1620334531,Bitcoin,"My story - from 2017 to now: How I have learnt to ignore everyday Bitcoin price movement, instead I am now focusing around the 2024 halving. Safe to say Bitcoin will be at least $500,000 in 2025.I started to hear about bitcoin in 2017 and started buying when Bitcoin was $5,000

Went through the 2017 hype and hodl through the 2019 crypto winter. I have to give myself credit for being a humble believer because i have seen so many people just giving up and quitting chat groups and just gave up on crypto between 2018 and 2019, which was totally understandable coz Bitcoin was at one point $3,500 and ethereum was $80 (from $1,400 atm). Yes that was grim and cold and hard and it was the most depressing period for all believers. I lost some coins due to trying to be clever and tried to trade the market but luckily i managed to keep most of the coins untouched.

Yet after the 2020 halving, the price is now $55,000..... 10x of what it was when i first moved in. Bit instead of getting mega excited like i was like at the 2017 year end $20,000 atm, for some reason i am ultra calm, like happy about its latest ATM but still calm.

Perhaps it is because i have been through this once already, how it may just gonna go mega crazy up up up and perhaps may slide down once again from $300,000 to $60,000 (80% fall just like before), like having that mental expectation relieves me from having to check price every 5 minutes

Instead i am looking forward to the 2024 halving, and most likely how it will be under priced (again) at that time, how the Republican may win again, and how maybe some central banks would start to buy. Yet the most sure thing is: in 2025 Bitcoin will reach $500,000

And so relaxed I am.....Bitcoin can go down 50% and up 300% like a yoyo like it has always done for the past 12 years and its cool.....Bitcoin will get us there.

Lets mark this post, and we will recircle back to this in 2024 - happy hodling everyone I hope this brief experience share will help."

1620333883,Bitcoin,"What would you do after the crash?Just a hypothetical but, pretend you knew the exact day Bitcoin would peak this cycle. It's pretty easy to guess that many of us would cash out right before that, but my question is, what would you do afterward?

If you knew tomorrow Bitcoin would spark a new crypto-winter, how would you use that knowledge to make a lot of money?

Some of my ideas:

1. See which stocks correlate the highest with Bitcoin price specifically, not just crypto. Equities like RIOT, MARA, and COIN are all probably highly correlated. I would purchase LEAP Puts on these for about 1 year out because Bitcoin normally bottoms out after 12 months.
2. Straight-up just short Bitcoin using a collateralized loan service like CoinLoan, purchase Bitcoin the day before the crash, exchange it for USDC, and after a year, pay back the BTC for a far lower price.
3. Other non-crypto hedges like gold/silver could possibly see a big inflow when crypto begins to top. Still unsure how inflation/deflation will be in the next 12 months though.

1620330919,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Long term questionHi fellow coiners
I’m a believer and hodler of BTC however a question has been nagging at me that I’m hoping you all can shed some light on. 

There have been some discussions on inflationary effects on digital currency. Also lots of threads on how governments can just print money whenever. One of the major crypto benefits is the decentralized control and inability to “print whenever some autocrat feels like it”

However my question is what happens to crypto’s like BTC when all of it is mined? Our n’économisa cannot survive without growth. That includes monetarily. Minting new currency is critical. When done correctly, the additional currency in the market represents additional value. 

For example if there’s a world where the only currency is $100 and the only product is 10 hamburgers, if an 11th hamburger is produced, all it does is deflate the value of the other 10. The total economic value remains the same. However! If there are 10 hamburgers and an 11th appears and at the same time another $1 appears, the total economic value increases. 

When BTC is fully mined...how will it continue to remain relèvent?

My question isn’t a knock on BTC or crypto, I need help understanding."

It is so obvious.....maybe too obvious thats why people dont see it.  Bitcoin works FOR YOU, thanks to all the developers and miners contributing to the development and security of the network. It is a thing that will just grow in value and all you do is just buy it and sit there. Simples.

I have done all i can in the past few years to get all my family, friends, colleagues on Bitcoin.....tbh not many of them are convinced and even fewer actually took action. 

But thats alright......as long as Bitcoin keeps working for me I will be able to financially look after the people around me after the next halving in 2024.

Wish everyone here a good weekend."

1620425793,Bitcoin,"How I no longer dominate BTC in USD.Hello,

People keep saying don't disclose, but I don't care I just want to share.

I had 10 Bitcoins. Sold back in January 2021. I had it in fiat for exactly **28 days** then realized how big of a fucking mistake I made. I fomoed back the day Tesla announced its purchase.  Long story short, my 10 Bitcoins is now 8. Although my bitcoin investment in fiat terms has quadrupled. I really hate that I give up my precious coins. I had some ETH and ALTs that I converted to Bitcoins, I have since poured 6 salaries into Bitcoin, and I still haven't reached 10 Bitcoins again. Fiat just doesn't seem valuable to me anymore. There's nothing I want more than a serious dip so I can clear the fuck out of the orderbook."

1620423685,Bitcoin,"Double check address before sending BTCI like to think of myself as a power user and have been in the space since 2014. I always held most of my Bitcoin on a hardware wallet and only kept tiny amount of sats on my phone wallet. Last night something happened which made me come here and make a post so that you guys don't fall for it as well.


I've always been an Android user and most attractive thing about Android for me was the ability to sideload apps. I had all kinds of sideloaded apps on my phone like VPN, livestreams, IPTV, Spotify, Camera apps and never had an issue before. I used one app named Mobdro for years for livestreams and such and it worked as expected, but a couple of weeks ago I got an update notification from this app and I clicked ""Update"" without thinking much about it. Last night I sent $35 worth of BTC to a friend and saw that the address this BTC was being sent to was not my friends address but it was too late since the TX was already in mempool. I quickly realized that my phone has been compromised and I had to factory reset it. 

Turns out the Mobdro app developer was [arrested last week](https://troypoint.com/mobdro-developer-arrested/) and somehow someone got access to their app resources and pushed an update containing malware which would detect a Bitcoin address copied in the clipboard and replaces it with one of the attackers address. So long story short, I ended up losing $35 of BTC to a stupid malicious app. 




TL;DR

* Always check the wallet address before sending your BTC
* Don't sideload/install unknown/malicious apps and give them full admin access to your phone/tablet/desktop. 
* Use a bloody hardware wallet."

1620520759,Bitcoin,"The Free Way I Learn About Anything OnlineAt a point in my life I was Soo broke

Not just of money but also information that I needed about Copywriting, crypto and self-help to get things right.

YouTube helped me a bit but what I really discovered was, to be good at anything fast, mentors me MUST inspire you.

But I wanted it all free.

I had no money of course and was using a free VPN to access the internet which might go off anytime.

If anything I needed then, was to find a bunch of mentors and binge on as much free content as possible.

Built it takes at least 6 months to get your hands on a great deal of such real mentors.

I know that out of experience.

But things changed pretty quick. Showing me all mentors who were game changers in the niche I was interested in.

Long story short: I made a lot of money from the free info I received from theses mentors I found once.

That wouldn't have been possible if I didn't see the website and the Reviews people made on every mentor.

It was a Free site with no ads but they had a bunch of mentor profiles.

In almost all niches and I found people that would have takene months to come across on IG.

Due to spam issues I can't type the direct link here but the website is called mentorcoursereview.

The mentors I found and followed on socials had bits of free knowledge on their social media which I applied.

I advise Newbies in any niche to gather mentors first.

It was a game changer for me. So it would be for you.

That's for today, hope this was insightful."

1620520250,Bitcoin,"CHANGE MY MIND: Massive BTC Crash in May before 100K to Moon 🚀Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Bitcoin is mad-frothy. I've been stacking btc and eth on a weekly basis and I strongly believe in the long term fundamentals.  But let's be honest, who actually believes Bitcoin will hit 100k without seeing another critical crash? (or crashes)

People on this sub are too quick to say ""things are different now"" but that seems more of a bias than anything else. Yes, there's absolutely increased institutional investment since the 2018 crash but i posit that Bitcoin is still quite far from widespread adoption.  

It's difficult to find a compelling case against the strong likelihood of an imminent critical crash. 

PREDICTION:

(Today: BTC reached high of 59K)
             
Crash to 20k by 2022.   
    
2023-2024: 100-250K.

1620519597,Bitcoin,"Opinions on BTC vs BCH**Let me be very clear, this post isn't for some heated theories debates on why one thinks the other sucks. I only want legitimate information and well thought out answers, please.**

I'm in a bit of an investors pickle. For so long I have thought that my end goal is to hold as much BTC and ETH as possible. But after looking into BCH over the past few days and experiencing it myself I really want to know what the BTC community think on why Bitcoin is better over Bitcoin cash and if you see these co-existing. 

  
I asked a similar question here on the fundamentals of BCH and why I should invest in it

[**https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/n80y2o/looking\_to\_invest\_have\_some\_questions/gxfx5ad/?context=3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoincash/comments/n80y2o/looking_to_invest_have_some_questions/gxfx5ad/?context=3) 

I figure I'm going to go big or go home on one of these two gems but I want to see what all you are thinking as well. Here what I've found so far.

1. BCH seems to be cheaper to transfer, faster and more secure 
2. It's growing a very nice upward trend and has now reached the top 10 market caps
3. I personally see both of these co-existing. BCT as a store of value like gold, eventually it will slowly increase in price as it becomes rarer. And I see BCH being the complete fiat replacement. I actually received I tip in the BCH sub and was blown away how I could get that without them knowing any of my account details or anything and it was instant.

What I'm looking for here is what the BTC community think as you guys are obviously fans of Bitcoin. Do you invest in both? Do you see only 1 ruling? Are there future patches that the Bitcoin foundation plan to release to compete? 

**Again this is not for heated debates. I only want well thought out opinions.**

1620508934,Bitcoin,"The Basics of BitcoinTLDR or Video version: [https://youtu.be/18lbumfiLw0](https://youtu.be/18lbumfiLw0)

**What is Bitcoin?**  
The digital gold, the future of currency, or, simply, the Federal Reserve's nightmare. Bitcoin and its satoshies (essentially, satoshis are to Bitcoin what cents are to a dollar. 1 Bitcoin = 100 Million satoshis = 100 Billion millisats) are the biggest and most established cryptocurrency with a market cap of roughly $1 Trillion. Bitcoin's main use is for peer-to-peer payments, although it's increasingly being used as a store of value (literally think of it like digital gold) and there are better payment-focused cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is based on a blockchain which serves as a decentralised ledger of transactions. Whenever a new block is verified and added to the existing blockchain by miners, that specific lucky miner is rewarded with a specific amount of Bitcoin which happens roughly every ten minutes. When Bitcoin was released, the reward per block was 50 Bitcoins, but right now, it is 6.25 Bitcoins per a verified block and that amount continues to halve every four years with the next halving happening in 2024.I will not get into the details, but if you're interested, I'll add some links to the description below.

**Why buy it?**

1. Limited supply unlike gold for example. You can always mine more gold, but there are only 21 Million bitcoins and that's it. Out of those, roughly 18.6-18.7 million have been mined, also known as the circulating supply, which leaves us with roughly 2.3 million Bitcoins unmined although it is projected that it will take another 100 years before they are all mined.
2. One of its best features is that it is unregulated and decentralised so no banks or middlemen are involved in a transaction, purely P2P which ensures anonymity to an extent. Why is that good? Again, unlike gold, the price cannot be enforced. Unlike paper money, no government can decide that they suddenly want to print $3 trillion to ""boost the economy"". (\*Biden, Powell stay in the background\*) This separation from government and other official currencies is why a lot of people are interested in Bitcoin although that applies to most, if not all, cryptos.
3. Diversification. I personally think it makes a lot of sense to have cryptocurrency in your portfolio to negate the effects of inflation, currency devaluation, etc. How much to hold depends on what is your risk tolerance. 
4. Bitcoin is established so it is the cryptocurrency that is least likely to be worth nothing. If you want crypto, but are worried, this is one of the safest choices. A very important feature of Bitcoin is that it is impossible to forge and nobody has been able to hack it, compromise it or interfere with the blockchain so far.

**Why does it go up?**

Two main reasons.

1. Currency devaluation. Only last year, the Federal Reserve printed 20% of all dollars ever! This year, they want to print even more. The more dollars there are in circulation, the less valuable the currency become and the more valuable real or limited supply assets start to be. 
2. Mainstream acceptance. While it's still got a long way to go, it is becoming very much mainstream. One of the most popular companies right now, Tesla, bought a lot of Bitcoins and started accepting them as payment. Other companies include Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Expedia, local branches of Burger King, KFC Canada, Overstock, some Subway branches, Twitch, the Dallas Mavericks, Zynga, etc.

Honorable mention: Elon Musk's tweets. Jokes aside, I'd honestly recommend making a twitter account and following some of the influential names in Cryptocurrency like Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, Scott Melker, the Winklewoss twins (yes, from the Facebook Social Network movie), Brian Armstrong, etc.

**How do you buy it?**  
A lot of ways! Binance, Coinbase, eToro, even online banks like Revolut. Whichever way you choose, make sure that you are the one who owns the cryptocurrency, not the broker or platform. Binance and Coinbase are two of the biggest players in the market so most people choose to use them. I personally own my cryptos through eToro, but it's up to you to decide.

Hope that covers the basics (sort of)! There's a lot more to talk about, but I think this is these is the bare minimum. What do you guys think?"

Some of the large mining pool operators are also anti-bitcoin. If taproot gets activated with speedy trial it will be good. But if speedy trial fails then it is a good reminder that confidence in miners is foolish and will only support the taproot lot=true UASF movement even more. No mater what, many of us who run nodes will activate taproot with LOT true with a UASF if we have to. And if the chain forks as a result, then the old out of date fork will be the losing chain in terms of value and acceptance. And anyone using the old fork will be punished for incompetence, and for supporting the anti-taproot chain. They will be punished through loss of the value of their holdings and use of the out of date chain. The taproot enabled fork will be known as Bitcoin. The non-taproot chain will be known as the discontinued chain.

Let this also be a reminder of the first three rules of Bitcoin:
1. Not your keys, not your coin
2. Not your node, not your rules.
3. Bitcoin requires self responsibility. If you do not like self responsibility and self-competence then Bitcoin is not for you.

YOU DO NOT OWN BITCOIN if you do not have sole custody. And if you are not using your own node, you lack any say in what rules are enforced and what chain you are on."

1620604930,Bitcoin,"Why is Bitcoin told to be the only cryptocurrency worth investing in ?Hi,

I've started investing in index funds for almost a year. Now, I'm very interested in understanding how cryptocurrencies and especially bitcoin work. I'm currently reading articles (recommended by this subreddit) and pursuing the open MIT Blockchain Course (on YouTube). 

Though, there is something that I don't understand. Why do people consider Bitcoin to be the one and only cryptocurrency that is worth investing in ? The main arguments usually pointed out are that it is the only true decentralised cryptocurrency and that it benefits from the network effect. When discussing with a friend more open to altcoins, I often struggle to make a point.

  
Could you explain why Bitcoin deserves its popularity and why altcoins do not ? Also, if you have any additional readings to share, I would be very grateful !"
1620604491,Bitcoin,"What will happen to society if cryptocurrency replaces countless institutions?To my understanding of blockchain tech... Which is very limited.. It has so many capabilities which will effectively make so many jobs unecessary. Smart contracts can help replace the need for lawyers and title companies in real estate deals and defi can help to replace many roles in banking institutions. These are just some examples but I have seen documentaries which provide an exhaustive list. The medical field can be affected along with data entry, government &amp; insurance fields. 

This can completely upend society and in many ways for the better... Generally with new tech comes new responsibilities and new employment opportunities. I wonder if blockchain industries will bring about enough employment to help what it replaces. Otherwise, if jobs are lost to the technology than that decreases the output of productivity due to there being no need for that productivity. That would make people poorer because they wouldn't be able to generate wealth through work and if they did work then it may end up being something more mundane then what they used to do. 

I get that this sounds backwards considering technology thus far has increased productivity immensely, which has generated great wealth, but blockchain tech almost seems autonomous in many ways to where it would actually reduce employment rather than increase it. It seems autonomous to the point where many jobs would become useless.

If blockchain tech and the industry it brings creates more jobs however, then that would be wonderful but people would need get used too and learn the technology. I think there are so many people that are failed by the school systems to where they are technologically illiterate in many ways.. Myself included, and taking up a new job role in block chain tech would be incredibly challenging. Many people may not want to go through those hurdles to learn new job roles this tech brings and they may not have the mental capacity to learn it. It seems like a ""giant step for mankind"" compared to a lawyer drawing up a Power of Attorney document. 

My biggest concern is that this tech will not be well received because of job replacement indications and the inability to adapt, along with the lack of jobs that this kind of tech will bring, or the very specific jobs that only a small population of people will be skilled enough to fullfill. I just wanted to share my thoughts on this and see what other people think."

\-Kraken  has no ACH only wires which are fairly spendy from bank especially if  not dealing in high volume, as well as high fees for withdrawls.

\-Coinbase pro seems decent, but terrible customer service and verification. Fees are not really too good.

I have a problem with logging into one of my [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) wallets

**I have two wallets:**

1) 29ebe\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*4f00 - I'm using it on daily basis, have no problems with logging into this wallet from both website and mobile phone (Android phone is tied to this wallet).

2) ea50\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*cbfd - on this wallet I do keep most of my funds, and **CAN NOT access** it from the website (it doesn't have phone tied to it).

**I have seeds, id, passwords for both accounts stored in secured place to which only I have an access.**

The steps are the following:

a) I open [Blockchain.com](https://Blockchain.com) website and then navigate to **Wallet** section. There I enter ID and Password. The website then asks my approve the browser via email.

b) Browser approved, 2fa field appears. But after I enter 100% correct 2fa code - nothing happens, only the grey dot keeps glowing, it's been like that for an hour now. See attached image.

What should I do?

Thank you!

1620590132,Bitcoin,"Complete anonymity- a good thing?Ok something I've been struggling with for a while. Bitcoin and crypto noob here so lots I don't yet know/fully comprehend.


1. So bitcoin, crypto in general, blockchain, indisputable breakthrough. Some of the great things it brings to society are clear and undeniable: bank the bankless, protect people from government surveillance, reduce inefficiencies with how we manage the economy, remove intermediaries in law and contracts, frictionless and instant payment systems, and so much more.

2. Now on to the one thing I can't wrap my mind around: total anonymity. It's great of course, we all know how surveillance and the tracking and storage of personal data is being used to favor the elites, small ultrawealthy groups that manage the big banks, corporations, etc. Decentralization and anonymity clearly tip the scales in favor of the little guy and can bring about a more just and fair society.

3. But doesn't it also open things up entirely for complete, systemic corruption? Massive movement of illicit funds, illegal activities that now even more efficiently affect societies in a very negative way? Is btc ultimately a libertarian project that dismisses this entirely?

4. I've seen some bitcoin proponents lately talk about regulating bitcoin in a way that's similar to the current financial system,  keeping stuff like KYC like some of the big exchanges do today. I can also think of amazing applications with stuff like cdbcs, where e.g. you can track how government funds meant to stimulate certain areas of the economy are being used, basically making corruption or misuse of government funds unfeasible. This would almost certainly be in favor of the little guy. Doesn't this defeat the purpose of the blockchain technology and crypto though, by still having entities in place that control and have access to it all? All this considered, I'm not sure if I can entirely embrace the alternative though.

Hoping to learn more as always from the great minds in this group"

1620694432,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is an underdog Boxer in a global fight.The underdog is almost always a socially loveable entity. 
They have to have qualities we admire on mass for their passion and determination. 
They fight to prove naysayers wrong, and start usually making small wins that tiny amounts of people appreciate and follow.
Their odds on victory as the go on start off as a joke, but they gain support and start worrying the bookies or house that stand to lose by letting theirselves set odds they think are sure things.
This is a global underdog that anyone can get a piece of right now, along with any others in the same group but younger in their career.
You dont need to even go all in on this underdog, if global perception was allowed to see bitcoin and other as the peoples champs, even 1% of your wealth by almost the whole world that can do so would make them unstoppable. 
The idea that we need to lose everything on it because it might get knocked out is a farce. 

Here is why, in world finance almost the entire worlds pop is backing the odds of the favourite anyway, you can remove some of that bet if we want to now and back the underdog, and if you just bet an amount you can afford to lose but have skin in the fight to enjoy and back the underdog that is fighting for almost all of us long term, you cannot lose. Its all FUD its trickery. 
If we all backed it with affordable loses come what may be. Than you will have won backing the underdog in a big way, or you have lost something that you could have lost endless ways and the favourite in the fight wins, 
Your backing the favourite 100% all eggs in now even if you dont see it.

Put a small bet on the 100\1 in a fight and you lose nothing really.
Failure to back the underdog or dogs in this fight means you fail to see that makes you susceptible to the defeat of almost all champs in history because you wont accept they cannot win forever.

Blind acceptance and complete financial stake in either fighter will never pay off.
And in this fight you cant opt out of the bet, your already in! 
Your choice has been removed, you either do nothing and therefore back fiat, or have a flutter on the underdog.
And you win! You win both ways.
This is the time you may not see again when the odds are in your favour as long as you dont leave a stake big enough in either fighter!"

I would probably gift them something around 2.5mBTC.  I am wondering what the best way would be to gift them this amount so they can hodl onto it for a few years.

We desperately need more forward thinking tokens in BSC, really enhancing groundbreaking tokens with a use case that compliment the ecosystem and I believe Moonlight Token is just that.

Moonlight’s first DexTool ‘PooCoin Promoted Alerts’ (PPA) notifies you the second a new token is listed on PooCoins Promoted list (Vetted/Unvetted).

But why?

PooCoin have unapologetically left skid marks all over the Binance Smart Chain, They are the go to place for charts, various premium features and promoted tokens, because of their massive popularity; Getting on that list pumps tokens

We’ve all seen it!

Back to Moonlight, With their first DexTool PooCoin Promoted Alerts (PPA) missing out on these new tokens will be a thing of the past.

They even have honest feedback from the community here;

https://twitter.com/moonlight_bsc/status/1390236263870046212?s=20

I'm personally up 7 bnb in a week, I’m extremely happy I found this gem!

🚀Smart Whale Tracker

The crypto space is a giant ring where investors from all over the world compete. But the fight is imbalanced. Whales have more resources and can alone influence price action. It is easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless.

🛠They want to create a Smart Tracker to follow the whales movements and act accordingly. For instance, you could buy right after a whale invests a large amount of BNBs because it will probably attract newcomers and create a pump!

🚀They’re very quickly approaching 7k wallets, get in while you can! the moonlight required to access this tool is 250 billion, with the price increasing daily; this is one not to miss! I’ve spoken to the team directly in the telegram and they have many ground breaking ideas for future tools!

1620679006,Bitcoin,"Rebirth of the Theory that Ross Ulbricht is Satoshi Nakamoto!!I was surprised when I found out on Reddit and other foruns that more people linked Ross Ulbricht to Satoshi Nakamoto! I mean, if Ross really is Satoshi (what seems completely plausible), he is a huge crazy-ass genious!! I mean, get people to believe in a ""Anarchical Coin"" and spread the word (maybe with some really close help) just to create a coin which would not be regularized by anyone and then, run his drug business empire... Man... People don't believe it could be true because Ross was caught, but Satoshi wouldn't be caught as he's intention was not the ""revolutionary theory"" behind Bitcoin BUT to fomment a community to start using the coin and aggregate some value to it and so, about 2 months later, people on darkweb would be linked to the coin facility and actually buy drugs from him with BTC. And, fellas, creating a joke digital coin has nothing to do with selling million of dollars in drugs on the internet.. so not to be compared... And the second reason, which comes to my concern, is that Ross could have had more money IF he didn,t sell drugs. It'd be true IF he also was Baba Vanga or had a time travelling machine to know that ""joke coin"" would actually be worth 64 thousand of dollars... So, what I think, truly, is that he might have bet on Bitcoin worth around $10,00 (no lies...) and he wanted to get advantage from that...

So two years ago I fell into the whole Bitcoin scene for the first time, bought some Satoshis and bought with them the normal stuff you could a this time like LSD and Shrooms nah just kidding, to be honest most of it was like online casinos and stuff like that. And after all that I had like 5 bucks left in Btc (started with around 20 bucks). 
I just forgot about it and left it.
The funny thing now it’s worth back the 20 bucks.
So all of this and now I am back into Bitcoin news and I was wondering about the always increasing mining cost and the halving cycle.
Doesn’t this totally f*** up the nature with the always increasing electricity power needed to close a Block and confirm it?
I mean I cannot judge the relativity to let’s say normal Household Power consumption but I guess it’s a lot.

The rumbles of the engines are going sideways, they've postponed the launch just a little bit longer so the old money can waddle on in secret.   


You walk into the rocket and take one look back at the Earth, outside the launch site you can see the masses squabbling over various other vehicles. You make out a huge hoard cheering around a giant train in the shape of a dog. You shake your head and board.  


Soon as the last of the old money boards the doors shut and the rocket takes off. Its going stratospheric leaving the earth behind it. You look out the cubby hole next to your comfortable seat and see the masses down below. Their cheering, fighting and jostling was ultimately meaningless in the grand scheme as they soon become as ants and you exit the atmosphere.   


The earth becomes a tiny speck and you are on a completely different level of existence. Your life is peaceful, secured you no longer have to concern yourself with the troubles of the ants.

 VIP account management, good payment options and great UX are a must.  

Let me know if you have any better suggestions - thanks"

THANK YOU"
1620763908,Bitcoin,"Just wanted to have a heart to heart with this community and why I feel you should be in it more for the chain, layers and may I say tech rather then the gains.While the worlds still grappling with covid and it's new way of life, perceptions we once had before our world felt like it was coming apart have and continue to change. You've also got hackers holding pipelines ransom, in turn completely disrupting physical infrastructure, a country that's still divided and won't accept election results, obviously monetary systems belts have become so lose their trousers might drop around the ankles at any moment. And for some reason most generally care about the price now, what it will be in 5 years, the fud that feels almost like hippies ranting against oil consumption and a fear or refusal that bitcoins energy consumption is worth it.

It's not all bad these days, I finally see people excited and working more with the lightning network layer which is awesome and applause go out to all of those folk who are setting up payment channels and really broadening what I want to talk about in the first place.

*The bitcoin blockchain's security*. Hold up, not in any bad way but hopefully I can share with you my perspectives on where it's going and why its incredibly important to the changes we already realize we should be making now.

Since we're mostly all familiar with lighting and I only understand it as an immediate transaction solution using liquidity pools and know that it's really just a layer on the network, in this case it clearly depends on the validity and integrity of the bitcoin blockchain and it not being compramised to continue operating.

Microsoft ION Digital ID network also to my understanding is at least partially on the bitcoin networks chain, along with the ethereum network and it's own, to ensure the data cannot be tampered with (and do correct me if I've missed something), again to insure its continued operation with trust.

What I'm trying to spell out is that the layers are quite important to the question of 'what is the use case of bitcoin?' And why people want it in their lives or not. Absolutely it works in a way of a store of value, a means of payment, in a sense a personal bank branch but overall the reward system of miners and entire ecosystem that's in place now is extremely secure, I'd easily argue the bitcoin network in terms or digital strength in a globalized world is **the strongest security backbone on planet earth that is completely decentralized and open source**.

You don't me to tell you what decentralized and open source means but again I want to reiterate there is a digital ID network being made that trusts the bitcoin blockchains validity and security enough that they want to use it as a backup. And if that grows even more desire for integrity and security will follow in time. If that doesn't have any weight on you, well I'm sorry I wasted your time but theres way more to the king of all blockchain and its price then shitcoin projects trying to do the same things with their own tokens and weaker chains. It's more likely other people trying to make money on an idea without having the backbone to support it with no long term strategy. There have been great coin ideas but they probably would have went further if they all just made layers and gave people more reason to support the main and longest open source decentralized chain. 


You want to trust election results? Build a layer on bitcoin.

Want to protect a fragile digitally driven infrastructure? Build a layer that uses bitcoin.


There's so many things you could create with ironclad like defenses with layering on top of the network, I just wish this was the kind of excitement I saw on this sub more often, legit people in it for the tech. Also you want to guarantee your funds will be there when you retire with your wallet after 20 years? Give the world a reason to want the bitcoin network, not find easy arguments against it.



 I bet people some people thought building the aqueducts was a waste of time, money, resources when everyone could just drink the old water from the dirty river, I bet their tunes changed once they witnessed the power the tech had brought all around them."

1620867572,Bitcoin,"Stop giving Elon credit, his tweet was just bad timingIt had nothing to do with his tweet, even though it seems that way.

There was a repeating 11-12 day cycle over the last 6 weeks. This is the 4th large drop, each drop was about 20-25%.

This was a pattern that was visible in the charts, I've been calling it for a few days now, except you downvoted me every time lol

But it has nothing to do with Elon's tweet, it was algorithmic.

If the pattern is correct, we should now have 10 days of climb back to about $60k (slightly lower than the previous high).

Or we may finally see a pattern break, which might finally take us about 10-15% over the last all-time high of $64k."

I've been thinking about strategies and buying bitcoin in the next bear-market, but now I'm reconsidering buying bitcoin at all. If more companies jump on this trend and don't accept bitcoin from public pressure and environmental effects, do you guys think this will affect the whole crypto-market? + I've read a little about why bitcoin uses so much energy in mining it and if it because of the mathematically complicated blockchain-system - wouldn't a less complicated one equal less fuel use? But on the flipside it might also mean that the less complicated blockchain is easier to counterfeit or am I wrong? I'm new to cryptos so answers would be great, and arguments for and against cryptos really being the future; because the announcement from Tesla might be one of the many announcements from other companies to come on not accepting the currency because of the environmental effects."

The fact that ALL the cryptocurrencies react in tandem is also disturbing considering there are many projects that zero correlation with others.

So, step one is to try to get the ""big boy"" Bitcoin to tank, all while saying he is doing it for ""environmental reasons""

- creates a ""certified green"" bitcoin marker to be added to the blockchain, and he'll mine ""green bitcoins""

- more likely, he just creates a bitcoin clone, but calls it *green coin* or somesuch, and then gets rich off the suckers that buy that one.

However, the guy speaks in cryptic code. Anyone who would’ve read into the tweet would have realized that a TSLA stock split was well underway. 

In Elon’s latest tweet, he mentioned that TSLA will no longer be accepting a certain coin anymore, due to the fact that the mining required results in large CO2 emissions. He then followed up by saying that they will consider alternate coins that can be mine while producing a fraction of the emissions.

Everyone is now scrambling trying trying to figure out what that coin may be. The bad news is that coin currently doesn’t exist. The good news is that the coin will soon be created by Tesla. I will call it TSLA coin for now, until the official coin becomes announced.

BUT TSLA IS A CAR COMPANY!!!!

Wrong, TSLA is tech company that focuses on green energy solutions such as electrification of vehicles, solar panels, energy storage AI, Autonomous driving, and soon to be announced TSLA coin.

TSLA coin will be the worlds most environmentally friendly currency and will probably be the currency of the future and Mars. I imagined that it’ll be mined via the TSLA battery walls - When the battery walls are fully charged from the solar panels, any excess energy will go towards mining TSLA coin. Furthermore, This will incentive more people to buy TSLA solar panels and TSLA battery walls, which will strengthen TSLA financials . 

Think about all the coins that Elon was able to pump the in the past. Now think about the endless pump potential this will have once TSLA coin gets announced. TSLA will most likely carry TSLA coin in its balance sheet and the more TSLA coin gets pumped, the stronger TSLA financials will become. And the stronger TSLA financials look, the more the stock price will climb.

TLDR: TSLA coin will be announced. TSLA to $69,420"

He actually refers to Tesla in his theory that people are confusing energy production with energy consumption, and suggests it's like saying that electric cars harm the environment because they use more energy in total than gasoline cars. 

He said that theoretically then if you are producing the energy for your Tesla with cold fired power plants , then they are more damaging to the environment.

He suggests the problem is regulating the way energy is produced not consumed. 

He says those that are determined to bash bitcoin will never change and the best thing to do is just ignore them. 

He points out that infact Bitcoin actually subsidises renewable energy."

1620949861,Bitcoin,"Am I being scammed?So I am doing a graphic designing job for a company who wanted to pay me in Bitcoin. I already own Bitcoin so I agreed. 

I was sent around $7,000 but it had to be this specific account/ wallet called BTC24.io due to the company only having the option to send Bitcoin through the internal site. I created an account and I was sent the money which was great. I then tried to take the money out at which point they said I needed to be verified. I sent pictures of me and my passport, a bill showing I was telling the truth about my address and also the contract between me and the company as proof of where the funds were from. 

They rejected my verification due to me not putting my btc24.io wallet details in the contract so they couldn’t prove that’s where the funds came from (total bullshit). The only was I could become verified was if I sent 0.025btc to the account. 

I sent 0.025btc from my coinbase to the btc24.io wallet for them to take a 1% commission which meant I hadn’t deposited the 0.025 but instead 0.02475. The amount had to be exact apparently. Later on I sent another 0.025btc with the promise that this would fix the verification issue and I would be able to withdraw my funds. 

Funnily enough that didn’t happen. I now have to link my external wallet and guess what the only way to link the account is... you guessed it, by sending 0.05 btc. 

I have now been promised once again that this will be the last thingy that is stopping me from being able to withdraw my funds...

I am now out of money. I’ve put over $2000 into something just to be told I need to put another $2000 in order to get to the next stage. 

Has anyone had any run ins with btc24.io and if so what happened to you? Is this company worth me putting in another 0.05btc in order to get my $9000 back??? Please help"

Guys wake up ! What the fuck ! Stop looking for a messiah, a guru or a leader, use your fucking own brain and do your research. If you think it makes sense to invest in bitcoin or other asset DO IT. And be accountable of your own decisions. 

Don't rely on others actions, moves, tweets and so.

If Musk was satoshi I would have accepted that his views was worth a satoshi or two but it is not the case. 
The guy has no better knowledge than you on this topic.

So keep doing your diligence and stay strong if you believe in that shit.

Bitcoin is more than 1 trillion so it is not 1.5 billions and 1 or 2 tweets which can change the market......Unless, unless, unless Weak hands and panicking and selling at any cost.

Almost all large mining operations use clean energy (almost always hydropower with the rare solar or wind powered farm)  The reason for this is people make dams in rivers all across the world.  Most of these are in the middle of nowhere.  A lot of times, all the nearby towns have enough power and the dam has tons of excess power.  A lot of times, big mining corporations step in and mine with it.  This energy is clean!

Yes, Bitcoin is a risk-on asset and could take a hit if the overall market is dropping, which it is. However, I would expect a lesser drop due to the fact that Bitcoin hedges against inflation and you would think there would be greater inflows. 

Also Elon, talking about the environmental factor but not selling any bitcoin (just not accepting it as payment). This could have been the easiest way that Tesla could move the bitcoin market lower without actually giving up bitcoin. Elon is a VERY smart guy and he wouldn't have bought $1.5 billion and changed his twitter to #Bitcoin if he didn't know how bad it was for the environment.

Basically bitcoins network is the most secure, open source and decentralized network humanity has right now. The world has a lot of problems. Bitcoin can't solve all of them but if more people focus on branching layers ontop of the network, your investment has a) protection because the network has real world applications and b) growth in value because the network has more then just 1 application just based around monetary movements.

I'm just advocating the community to take a more logical approach then getting your body parts rigid looking at the news and whatnot like it's just money.

# Moral Intuitions and Moral Nativism

*The Oxford Handbook of Moral Psychology (M. Vargas &amp; J. Doris, Eds.), Forthcoming*

44 Pages Posted: 15 Dec 2020

Georgetown University Law Center

Date Written: December 10, 2020

### Abstract

Moral nativism is a theory of moral cognition which holds that significant elements of human moral psychology are innate. In this invited chapter for The Oxford Handbook of Moral Psychology, I first summarize the intuitive turn in recent moral psychology and explain its significance for moral nativism. Drawing on an analogy to language, I then outline two principal arguments for moral nativism: the argument for moral grammar and the argument from the poverty of the moral stimulus. After making some terminological clarifications and correcting some popular misconceptions, I then review some of the most significant research supporting moral nativism, including empirical studies of compassion, empathy, and altruistic motivation in humans and other primates; the intuitive jurisprudence of young children; the emergence of moral cognition in human infants and toddlers; the neurocognitive foundations of moral judgment; and human moral universals. The chapter concludes by locating moral nativism within a broader historical and scientific context, including ancient philosophy (e.g., Plato’s Meno), Enlightenment rationalism (e.g., Descartes’ Treatise on Man), evolutionary theory (e.g., Darwin’s Descent of Man), and the modern cognitive science of innate knowledge.

1621037750,Bitcoin,"New to Mining, so i have a question.

So I am fairly new to the actual works of BTC mining but here are the key points for my question.
-Mining is verifying transactions and being rewarded for it
-The amount of Reward was reduced in 2020
Will the amount of reward go down in the future? And if so:
The more people want to use BTC, the more ""verifiers"" we need.
The less the reward, the less people will be willing to mine.
How will cryptocurrencies ensure there are enough miners? How will they motivate them?
If there are higher rewards, there will be inflation. If mining doesn't pay, there wont be miners, and the currency will crash.
If I missunderstood something completely here or If my question is actually something to think about, please tell me.

&amp;#x200B;

I  was not anticipating making an update before June; but Elon being Elon &amp; here we are.  We did pierce the prior swing low of 48k which I was not expecting; but so far the 20 Week MA has held!

I  think the 48k low would have held if not for people capitulating based on Elon's tweets.  The good news is leverage was flushed from the system.  We also have touched the 20 Week MA which has historically held support in bitcoin bull markets and led to further upside.

&amp;#x200B;

By the way - I have not moved those yellow price lines since Jan - pretty cool!

&amp;#x200B;

I  still think the first part of the cycle to \~209k over the next \~13 weeks holds true then a pullback to the 20WMA again (we will revisit in a future update where exactly that moving average is in July).

2. There are no maintenance, insurance, tax, or any other expenses required to maintain your investment in BTC. Your BTC can not burn down or wash away in a flood. You cannot be sued for someone dying on your BTC.

3.Liquidity. It is much faster, cheaper and frictionless to buy/sell BTC than a home. Ranked last here because everyone knows that we HODL."
1621034258,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Short Anxiety (Serious lol, Please Help)Since  I've been converted to the religion that is Bitcoin, I've had a  surprising amount of anxiety over being short. The result, is that I  can't really buy dips, and the price effects my mood too much, despite  the fact that I never intend on selling. Let me explain:

Every  time I get new money, within a day or two it all goes into Bitcoin. I  just can't help it. I'm so terrified (FOMO) that the consolidation is  going to end and the price is going to double in a week like it did in  January.

I firmly believe this is  the greatest asset in the world, and the current price is extremely  irrational. The current price (roughly) implies it only has a 10% chance  to go to 500k within a few years, which is just... unbelievably low. So  even when I look at the price and it's 57k, I can't help but just buy  it, fearing that soon everyone is gonna finally wake up and the 50-60k  BTC will be gone forever.

Then  Elon tweets something stupid and it crashes to 47k, and I don't have  money to buy the dip because I fomo'ed all of it in already, lol. But  it's really hard not to, because when it drops down to 53k and then goes  back up to 58k, I also regret not buying at 53k.

I'm  just kind of a mess, psychologically. What system do you guys use for  not going crazy from Bitcoin short anxiety? Do you set an arbitrary  threshold: something like ""I'll buy dips of &gt;20%, and hold the cash  for dips &lt;20%?

It's also  relevant because right now we're sitting at 49-50k (great price based on  the last month), and yet there's still a chance that support shatters  and we end up down around 42k, but there's also a chance we just blast  off to 100k from here.

Typically,  I'm a rationalist, but this Bitcoin short anxiety has turned me into an  irrational mess subject to every cognitive fallacy in the book.

Please advise."

I bought Bitcoin through coinbase in January.

Currently Bitcoin is sitting at £49k so I would expect to see the price of £500 higher if I was to sell it, but it’s showing me it’s only worth £470. 

Is this because of the conversion rate between Bitcoin and my currency? 

Should I be looking to convert my Bitcoin to another crypto that has a better conversion rate to my currency which would give me a better price?

As a hobby, I would like to buy a few hundred pounds (I'm in the UK) of Bitcoin. I am not gambling with it - the amounts I am planning on spending are well within my disposable income. That does not mean I simply wish to dispose of the money frivolously however.  


I want to hold onto the currency to help me understand it - and hopefully prepare me for a time when it may be more widely adopted.

\- What is the most secure way to store Bitcoin long term?  
\- Ideally, I want to store the coins in a way that doesn't rely on someone else holding the keys to it (please explain how Bitcoin are 'stored' from a user interface point of view)

And with these points you can win bitcoins. It's really easy to use the application and above all fun to play. And if you use my code, we'll both earn extra points.
And finally you can also win chsb tokens!
I leave you the link of the application and my code so that we both win points :)

1621124494,Bitcoin,"Remembering Bitcoin's Roots Once upon a time we were all alone in the world of crypto currencies. There were no alts to get caught up on and no big businesses involved in the space, and definitely no Twitter or YouTube talking heads to distract anyone from the mission.  

It was a super fun and exciting time where there was a real sense of its “us against the world”. It was full of creative out of the box thinkers and techies in love with this idea of digital money.  

We’d get excited by people building bitcoin matrix screensavers and sites like sounds of bitcoin. There were no apps to download, no flashy charts, no coindesk and barely any exchanges… All we had was bitcoinity.org. No-one cared much about the price. Rather, threads in here and on bitcointalk were abuzz with ideas about all the cool stuff we could actually build with programmable money (we did the first NFTs on bitcoin, for instance, wayyy back in 2014 btw).  

We didn’t have to go cap in hand to VCs to get an idea off the ground. We went to each other and we just made it happen.

Of course we yearned for the technology to one day become mainstream - many of us felt it was capable of saving the planet, after all. Although we were wise enough to understand it was most certainly not going to be a panacea for all the world's ills. But that maybe, just maybe, it could help make the world a better place.

Our most powerful traits as a community were our altruism and kindness, our willingness to share ideas, and our desire to see others doing well in the world… we would be constantly rallying together to help people during the many crises happening in the outside world as a result of the financial shockwaves that followed the 2008 crisis. We were NICE people.

There were no cyber hornets causing mayhem (well, maybe a little :p). All in all we were rather humble and gentle sweet little community of misfits and weirdos deeply troubled by the things going on in the world and united behind a technology we had decided ought be able to help tip the balance in favour of the underdogs, if only for a short while.   


And we very funny at times. We’d put up stupid billboard ads with [honey badgers](https://media.wired.com/photos/5932fe704cd5ce6f96c0bfab/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/honeybadger.jpg) and this reddit was dominated by little mom and pop businesses all over the globe posting pictures of their “bitcoin accepted” signs.  

The world back then wasn’t dominated by bitcoin billboard ads that had come out of a marketing PR agency, sponsored by the latest exchange. 

We also used to make really good art and memes in this reddit that truly inspired people around the world. Zhou Tonged made that stunning [“Cypress Anthem”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc6Hp_Zq3rU) during the Cyprus Bail-in which really hammered home the “Why?” of bitcoin.

Later, during the Greek riots when capital controls were put in place, I remember developing our [Plan B Greece meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3a86kf/time_for_plan_b_v2_greek_translation/) in a thread on here. An idea that just grew organically, and we figured out as a community how to perfect.

I checked reddit the next evening to see a CEO of a bitcoin company in the U.S. had flown all the way over to Athens, had the meme printed out on thousands of flyers, and was stood on the parliament steps there handing it out to ordinary people affected by the crisis.

That evening bitcoiners organised for 100s of people to meet in the town hall, where they were introduced to the tech and given free bitcoins, and we all bought pizza for the locals - paid for by tips sent through the reddit tip bot.  There was a real sense that ""wow!  we're really bringing people together and spreading hope"" and doing so in a totally decentralised way.  And there wasn't a single tech giant CEO in sight calling the shots.

One of the many moments that bought tears to my eyes was that trailer of ‘[the rise and rise of bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-H6QuIv8OSI)’ where the little kid says “I”m going to college because my Dad mined bitcoin!”. Ahhhh, those lovely days when ordinary people could mine bitcoin on their own computers, back before it got taken over by big business mining cartels.

And you know what? During those times, there was barely a single price post here (we’d send people to r/bitcoinmarkets for that kind of chat) and there was never any posts of twitter talking heads or news posts about billionaires saying this or that, leading us all like little lambs into their little Wall St. divide and conquer market manipulation games.  

As far as we were concerned if billionaires were that good at managing the world and technology, there never would have been a need for bitcoin in the first place, right? So we really didn’t pay much attention to what they had to say about an internet technology they had no qualifications to be commenting about it.

As for those other alts?  

Those of us who have been around building things on the internet and involved in bitcoin since the beginning were never against alts. That’s the entire point of building an open source protocol - to allow the ecosystem to go create a bunch more versions and try things in a different way, enabling the wider crypto movement to gain in strength and diversity from the many moving parts. Imagine if there’d only been one flavour of Linux allowed to compete… no doubt it would have turned out to be as broken and lacking in innovation as Windows…

It was bitcoiners that funded Vitalik (via the world’s first ICO) to go make his Turing complete smart contract ‘world computer’ a reality. Vitalik had been a major part of bitcoin and bitcoinmagazine. And those of us who enjoy seeing others succeed, wished him the absolute best with his new project. A bunch of us did pretty well out of that ICO too, thanks to all the hard work Vitalik and friends put into it.

We were happy to see the Doggy people funding things like Jamaican bobsleds and bringing us all much needed light relief with their silly “much wow!” stuff. Real bitcoiners who remember the “Why?” of all this are over the moon to see a resurgence in their gentle little community of late, and people doing well from it all. It is we, after all, that made it all possible.

Things only started going downhill when big business Wall St. billionaire investors - who have never built anything of importance on the internet - swooped in and started calling the shots, coupled with a bunch of cyberhornet maximalists who forgot that bigger picture open source “Why?” and decided all this had to be a zero sum game. Exactly what Wall St. wanted to happen of course, divide and conquer being the perfect strategy to separate an otherwise perfectly harmonious crypto community that could and should get along perfectly well given we all have far more in common with each other than we differences. 

Truth is those investors and hardcore maximalists (themselves now multi-millionaires) don’t give a damn about things like the open source “information wants to be free” ethic the web (and bitcoin) was founded upon, and many have now forgotten our very humble beginnings.

Proof once again that power and money corrupts and how much we - as a community - have diverged from our original roots, divided by twitter talking heads and big business bullshit as we share celebratory articles from economics magazines about how banks are going to be adopting bitcoin.

This is the gentrification of bitcoin; the inevitability of mainstream success. We are now seen as “Boomer Coin” by younger generations. And that’s okay, because that old world needed to get its foot in the door and stop fighting all this. And truth is, bitcoin is very old now. A strong and stable, reliable workhorse being run by billionaires. 

But a happy, vibrant community of strong willed philanthropic individuals that will fly out to Greece without a moments hesitation to go help locals in trouble, we are no more.  

If we were, this reddit right now would be full of posts of people helping out in the Covid crisis in India and Brazil. Instead it’s full of billionaire tweets and price movements. As if the chart is the only thing that matters.    


***""It’s called a changeover, the movie goes on and nobody in the audience notices a thing."" - The Narrator***  


We are now a plaything of billionaire investors who have made a bigger, faster, stronger version of the hedge fund “greed is good” capitalism we set out to disrupt, to be assimilated into the SWIFT and Visa network so that old system can continue to chug along as if nothing happened. 

Satoshi knew it would come to this of course, he always said at best bitcoin would only be able to buy us a little time in that ‘war’.

There’s no need to be sad about any of this... Like towns that were once shitholes full of dodgy night clubs and drug dealers, which artists and misfits move into and manage to transform through their art and music…. eventually they get gentrified, cleansed, and the money people move in making it nice and safe… Same happened with vast swathes of the internet of course.  

In many ways the fact that banks are adopting bitcoin and posts in here celebrate institutions and billionaires like Michael Sailor coming onboard (he was very much against bitcoin at the outset)… it means, well, we have succeeded.  

But it’s high time we stopped pretending this is a movement of the people, for the people. It’s not and probably never can be now.  

It’s likely going to be a nice, clean, safe little currency that the vast majority of Western populaces and banking institutions can rely on as a secure store of value, and most people will probably be using it to do everyday transactions via SWIFT and Visa without even knowing they’re using layer 2/3 of bitcoin.  So in some weird, perverse way, that ""and then they join you"" phase has worked.  Just not how we expected it to.  Best laid plans of mice and men, eh?

None of that changes the fact that there is all this art and beauty in the world that bitcoin inspired and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people we managed to elevate out of poverty back at the beginning... Nor does it change the fact that somewhere out there, there’s a kid in the world who is graduating from college this year because his Dad once mined bitcoin."

I do service work for air conditioning, this new customer of mine needs to replace these Old hack and slash AC units. Pretty decent size business. He scraps electronics. Phones. Computers, separates them for the metals etc.

Hes been in business for 11 years and as of 2018 when the market crashed he decided it was a good idea to tear the mother boards out of comps and save them. As a hobby he scans them for possibly old forgotten wallets or private keys.

I saw his office he works out if. It's just piles of hard drives everywhere and some equipment he can insert hard rives and scan them.

So far he's found a total of 4.1 Bitcoins on 3 different computers and some ETH and other shitcoins. and currently has a wallet he doesn't have the keys too that contains an unknown number of btc.

He said it's pure hobby because the efforts it took to get those bitcoins he barely broke even. Also he doest have the time to scan all of them as so many come in so he showed me this back room that is packed like sardines with hard drives and mother boards .

Probably take him forever and it's getting to the point he's running out of room. That's how much scrap he hauls in but he has this wacky idea of some automated self learning machine that can read hard drives for him.

But who knows. He might stumble across one PK that has $$millions$$ in BTC."

1621114850,Bitcoin,"Why the energy FUD might not be so bad after allI’m going to preface this by saying that the energy FUD seems too extreme to me. I started digging into energy usage globally and was pretty shocked to find that something like 30-60% of energy is wasted due to grid inefficiencies, poor building insulation, using energy when offices are empty, using inefficient bulbs etc.

When you compare that to the 0.1-0.15% of energy used globally for Bitcoin, which sustains the network of the number 1 cryptocurrency in the world, the energy FUD seems overblown. 

However, whilst reflecting earlier today I started to think about how this might pan out. Here’s what I came up with:

Bitcoin mining is like any business and ultimately it’s about generating maximum profits. 

Bitcoin mining only remains profitable and/or becomes more profitable as long as Bitcoin’s price stays high or increases. 

We live in a world now where whether we like it or not, being climate conscious is important to businesses, governments and individuals. ESG is an evolving part of business and investments and will only become more important. 

As much it pains me to admit it, Bitcoin’s market cap will be *somewhat* limited by how green it is. Only so many individuals, businesses, wealth funds etc. will store it and transact in it whilst a question mark remains over its green credentials. 

Based on all the above and seeing how market trends have played out in ESG, leads me to believe that miners will continually strive to be greener in their operations. As a miner, not only will you will be able to more easily seek capital/investment to begin/expand operations if you can demonstrate a willingness to be green, but you also contribute towards a greener mining network, which in aggregate serves to boost the price of Bitcoin and hence potential for future profits. 

It’s true that there will always be some non-green players, and this can’t be stopped per say in a decentralised system with a fungible coin, but I believe the incentives will be heavily weighted as such that those who are more climate conscious, are able to outnumber and even ‘make up’ for those miners that don’t use renewable energy, by for example carbon offsetting.

I feel like the energy FUD is an open invite for Bitcoin miners to become greener and in doing so, further boost there future rewards. It almost felt like (on reflection, I was annoyed at first) a certain billionaire’s comments were a way of throwing down the gauntlet, and I think the Bitcoin network will embrace the challenge."

1621109380,Bitcoin,"PoW vs PoSPoS voting system

Over time, there will be important issues to decide. In voting for this issues, part of the validators will prefer path A (maybe for selfish profit, or ideology, or outside pressures, or whatever) while part of the validators will prefer path B. If issue at hand is of neutral topic, eg. technical one, then it would probably divide stakers to groups A and B in neutral manner regarding their financial power/staking size.

However, if issue at hand is of financial repercussions, or regarding future power decisions (eg. minimal staking size), then interests could happen to be strongly aligned along the total staking size of stakers. This presents a threat. Big stakers could have their interests to be opposite to small stakers.

Pareto distribution is unavoidable. Expect 20% of stakers to control 80% of staked eth. This will hold for all eth staking sizes, even big ones. This is permanent incentive for big stakers to take power and make their will. If stake becomes bigger power becomes more centralised. At that point outside influences can start show themself (eg. central banks,...) due to lack of decentralisation.

PoW bitcoin

PoW can have the same issue. However, bitcoin has shown in Segwit drama that real power is with nodes, not with miners. Nodes are where bitcoiners are. Miners are only paid service. During segwit drama, and it lasted for a year or so, miners were 80% all for block size increase but they still couldn't activate it. Why? Bitcoiners are where nodes are. Miners would fork-off and mine their own blockchain, but all bitcoins (bitcoin owners, services, developers) would stick to old blockchain. Miners were powerless for human capital reason. So in this sense bitcoin has PoS with serious bitcoiners and services running their own nodes.

I'm typing this with pains in my heart....
It's sad that we would enter this Crypto space and work tirelessly just to get the bag and a little mistake of not knowing your seed phrase would take everything away from you.

A friend got robbed yesterday and they took his phone and everything now he can't access his wallets because he didn't know his seed phrase or probably didn't even write it down just saved it on phone.

All Solana Airdrops worth $15k gone
Trust wallet funds gone
Sol token  worth $12k gone.

Please please please this is not a request but a command *WRITE DOWN ALL YOUR SEED PHRASE AND GIVE TO YOUR MOM*.
Tell her how important it is so she keeps it well.

Teach her how to use it incase anything happens.

Let us not allow all our work in this space be in vain please🙏🙏

Thank you❤"

1621109145,Bitcoin,"Musk and Saylor Are irrelevantThe evolution doesn’t happen with one or two people but millions. Just like in Politics not a single politician has enough resources or power to make any changes, instead the society has a final say on where things will develop towards to. So is with crypto world and btc. There are millions of people that combined have a vastly greater lever effect than any so called successful and rich. When speaking of Musk, he relies on btc to show profits in his unprofitable business which will never become profitable due to the conservation of momentum. 

So chill and enjoy the ride. In the end it will be up to the society as a whole to accept and advance the crypto currency technology."

1621213067,Bitcoin,"at home diagnostics for btc biohackersTLDR;

I am working at a diagnostics company (SiPhox) during my time off from Stanford undergrad and we are exploring opening a 6-month beta program to engage early adopters who are willing to perform weekly at-home measurements of key aging/wellness biomarkers &amp; share anonymized data.

Let me know if you are interested here:[https://62w854wvmav.typeform.com/to/rl9LZmGr#source=](https://62w854wvmav.typeform.com/to/rl9LZmGr#source=crypto)

Personally, I am testing out several things including NMN and fasting and am very curious about how this is affecting my biomarkers over time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The full story:

The goal of the SiPhox Longevity beta will be to provide users real-time, longitudinal feedback on how their lifestyle choices impact key biomarkers. Beta users will be expected to perform weekly at-home blood tests requiring one hundred microliters of blood, drawn from the shoulder using a patch, ensuring a relatively painless draw compared to traditional finger-prick methods.

What’s the point of weekly testing?

No significant dataset like this exists. It’s generally accepted that sleep monitors, activity and heart rate monitors as well as continuous glucose monitoring can be great tools for closing the feedback loop between lifestyle choices and wellness outcomes.

Today, blood tests are expensive, infrequent, and not tailored to investigate things like aging processes. Although many people are eager to improve their health via fasting, exercise, supplements, sleep habits, and more, they receive little to no feedback on how effective these practices are and the research community never collects any data on their self-experimentation.

We plan to close that feedback loop, providing weekly progress reports on key aging biomarkers that change with chronological age &amp; age related diseases. These markers will help users characterize how quickly their different systems —cardiovascular, neurological, metabolic, inflammatory — are aging. We will collect anonymized data and share the insights from this novel longitudinal study with our users, making their biohacking process more informed and scientific.

If this Beta sounds like something you might be interested in please fill out [this form](https://62w854wvmav.typeform.com/to/rl9LZmGr#source=crypto)  to ensure early access"

Hello everyone, I hope you are well and I know that maybe this is wrong for me to make this post, but I will try to say a little and I apologize to those who may be offended by my publication. Since some years my situation in Venezuela has been quite frustrating, working a month to only buy food for a couple of days is desperate and I do not know what to do, I feel I am at the limit with the madness of this country, at the beginning of 2020 I finally got my passport. The last week I have been talking to my mother and I think the best option is to go to any nearby country where I can have a job and be able to send money to my family, I have a 2 year old daughter that I do not want to continue growing under the distance and corruption of this country. I would like to be able to take my daughter out of this country someday and give her a better education in another place and that she does not learn from what is lived in this country where it is normal daily deaths due to malnutrition or malpractice in a hospital.... I want to ask for help to those who have the possibility to do so, to help me with anything that will help me to even pay a but ticket to the fronters of Brazil or Colombia and finally get out of here.

I came to Reddit because I know it's a great community and I thought I could find some help. Anyone who can lend me anything, I promise to return the favor as soon as I find a job. In my house in Venezuela there are days where there is nothing to eat and it's hard to sleep without food and not knowing what you're going to eat the next day. So I would just like to change my mother's days a little bit and give my daughter a better growth.

Anyone who can help with anything or at least help with advice, I would appreciate it. Thank you all for reading and forgive me for this, I am quite embarrassed, but my desperation is greater than the embarrassment"

Coldcard said it was a bug and just to update the firmware. Well I got the Coldcard to use 100% offline, so I never, ever, planned on updating the firmware. I planned on generating a wallet offline, sending funds to it using the QR codes on the device's screen, and never touching it again until it was time to spend those funds on the moon.

So yea, confidence in the Coldcard isn't high right now. Ultimately I'm trusting them not to have put in malicious firmware, or somehow allowed someone else to, and I feel like there's a lot of double speak going on. The way I understood it if that red light doesn't go off, you're supposed to send it back to them, and here they are telling me basically just not to worry about it. If I understand it correctly, there's no way to know if it's an actual bug, or if the firmware was somehow compromised in the factory, so basically I can never trust it now.

In any case, updating the firmware exposes it to the internet, and completely negates the whole reason I bought it. I mean, if I'm going to expose it to the internet, I might as well just stick with my Ledger."

1621295941,Bitcoin,"Why PoW works in a nutshell.I was trying to explain this to someone and I feel like I nailed it. I want to write out my interpretation, hopefully it will help others to get it.

Bitcoin needs a fair system to resolve conflicting inputs (conflicting transactions). A user can spend their money one place and then again to another place, but only one of these should be allowed. 

**How do we solve this?**

\- Can't do it based on time, computers are awful at time. 

\- Can't do it based on anything in the input itself because new conflicting inputs can be sent at a later time and be crafted to replace the old input and we can't resolve future conflicts in advance. 

\- Anything predictable can be attacked.

\- We can't rely on trust based systems, that is the opposite of what we want.

Instead, we need people and their computers to do the conflict resolution. How do we do this without a centralising effect? We want to give the responsibility of conflict resolution to everyone as fairly (as randomly) as possible, but in order to do this, we need to pick people from random out of a **set** of options (set is a mathematical term, look it up to understand where I am coming from).

**What can we measure and use as our set?**

\- We can't base it on nodes on the network, because nodes themselves are virtual and we cannot guarantee that nodes (virtual or physical alike) will be fairly distributed among users.

\- We can't base it on unit of currency, because money itself is already unfairly distributed.

\- **Energy is something that is difficult if not impossible to centralise (at least that is my theory). No central government or authority can generate and use more energy than the majority of its people collectively.**

If we allow Bitcoin to pick from a set of energy expenditure proofs, we are picking randomly across a set as fairly distributed as we can.

In actuality, the contract is reversed. There is no central thing picking from a random set, but rather, each unit of energy is used to participate in a probabilistic challenge. The effect is the same.

After describing this, I think it is obvious why PoS can never take place of PoW as a fair way to distribute the conflict resolution task because it always picks from a set that can be centralised. 

Bitcoin's PoW is not only used to stop double spends either. It is used to track consensus on things like network upgrades as well. I can't imagine any other system that can do what PoW can do."

Well, OK, so what's the limit? When is more hash pointless? When is more energy consumption wasteful?  

I mean, most websites don't allow infinite length passwords. Most security is based on SHA256, not SHA512. Network and computer security can always be stronger, but there is a point at which, based on probability, the strength of certain types of security is ""good enough"".  

So what is that amount in terms of hash? What amount of hash/energy consumption are we willing to tolerate before we say that the network can't be attacked and that nothing more is needed?"

If $50 were invested monthly at an average cost of $70,000 (average of current price and $100,000 target) it would take 35,280,000 individuals to buy up all new supply.

35,280,000 is a large number, but let's add some context.

There are estimated to be 6,500,000,000 people living in 1st and 2nd world countries. (dollar a day 3rd world populations excluded)

Excluding citizens of the 2nd and 3rd world there are 1,489,800,000 people.

1621290441,Bitcoin,"None Of You Have Lost Any Money1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin.

Nothing has changed about what a bitcoin is. You knew going in that there would be ups **and downs**. Always has been and always will be.

Sure - temporarily, your purchasing power is less. You shouldn't have put money in bitcoin that you needed to spend in the short term.

Sure - you can sell your bitcoin for a low price if that makes you happier. It doesn't change anything - only locks in your purchasing power.

Yep, maybe the price will keep dropping. Nobody knows where the bottom is. You do not know where the bottom is. Don't try to guess where the bottom is.  You are not smarter than the market. The moment the majority of people finish selling **is** the bottom. Don't be in the majority who sell at the bottom.

The best thing to do in a bear market **for a solid asset you understand and believe in** is (1) nothing at all, (2) any trades you wanted to do between similar correlated assets to get tax advantages, or (3) buy more if you can. Maybe it will go down further, but most assets are negatively correlated - meaning if they go down they are more likely to go up after - in general.

If you have too much bitcoin, and you feel like it's too much stress, then you should have sold before in the bull market. Next time, don't forget to sell during the bull run if you can't handle the risk of a drop in your current exposure level. Bitcoin can drop in relative fiat value at any time.

If you can't stand the volatility at all, then sell out during the next bull run at a price you're satisfied with. Don't wait until the next drop, because it will drop again. Do your research and reassess your risk tolerance before coming back in. Expect massive drops and be honest with yourself!

But most important - only buy things you understand. It takes a long time to understand bitcoin and what it is and how to keep your bitcoin safe. When you understand that, you will feel better. But until then, of course, it will feel crazy and uncertain and stressful. There is no rush - you are still early. Take your time to learn before you invest your hard-earned money in anything."

1621376906,Bitcoin,"Why ""Gold/Silver/Oil/etc. has other useful physical properties"" is not a desirable argument against BitcoinIn the article [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) (which highly I encourage you to read in its entirety), the author introduces a concept called **monetary premium**, which is the value that is added on top of a good because of its function as money. Put another way:  The difference between the purchasing power of a monetary good and the exchange-value it could command for its inherent usefulness can be thought of as a ""monetary premium"".

For instance, proponents of gold as a store of value mention its useful physical properties as desirable. They mention gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity, it's malleable and ductible,  it's shiny and pretty. And yet, we have other metals with the aforementioned properties which aren't worth as much as gold. The reason for this is that gold is treated as money. The same is true for other goods, but gold has been known to be treated as money through history more than others, and so commands a higher monetary premium.

[Monetary premium for different monetary goods](https://preview.redd.it/yqkden4agyz61.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d52c21747ba9b7b978579a64e0cca669059e93e1)

Now here's where things get interesting: Many goods are being used for their ""store of value"" characteristic, which is also a property of money. Real estate, collectibles, commodities such as lumber, oil, etc. are being hoarded not because of their useful properties (i.e. not because these people actually intend to use these goods as raw materials for the creation of any product), but because they serve as a hedge against the declining worth of national currencies. This creates artificial scarcity, which in turn means that **these goods end up costing more because of the monetary premium being assigned to them by virtue of being used as money**.

Imagine a world where gold was worth only what its physical properties meant it should be worth. Many consumer electronic goods might end up cheaper, as they use gold for many purposes ([as do many other industries](https://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml)). What if real estate wasn't used as a store of value? [Housing and rent would not be skyrocketing as it has been for a while](https://www.boston25news.com/news/housing-prices-continue-soar-is-this-now-bubble/XVOF2SXXUZHITCIXZFQ7HXJBVM/), as they would only be bought only by people that actually wanted a home and not by speculators and people that wanted to protect their wealth. I could probably go on and on.

What this means is that **many industries view their prices inflating because of the constant hoarding of the raw materials they need for production by people looking for a safe haven asset,** which in turn means the consumer and the businesses suffer the consequences of shortages.

What would happen if there was a safe haven asset whose only purpose was to serve as sound money? What if it was safe, out of reach from the hands of politicians and regulators? What if you didn't lose value by holding, but instead had greater returns by holding it over other assets? **What if trillions of dollars went into Bitcoin and stayed there?** My guess is there would be a net benefit in productivity all over the world, and you and I would benefit in the long run. So if you want industries to flourish, hoard only bitcoin."

1621374235,Bitcoin,"Why I converted back to BTC? 

WHY I CONVERTED ETH BACK TO BTC.  
This should rile up a few people.  
Like    a great True Romance Novel, I am back in love with BTC. Why? Last  week  I  was bashing BTC as the Dark Side because of the the amount of  energy  needed for Mining and I didn't want to be associated with an  investment   that has a negative impact on the planet. Great, but lets  look into  this  further. For me, the crypto arena is too esoteric to  fully  understand  all at once. It takes time and proper filtration to   understand all the  yin and yang of this growing asset of value.

I am finally understanding that BTC is three dimensional in its own meme.

First dimension:  BTC cannot be corrupted and only 21 million coins.

Second    Dimension: BTC will become the benchmark of world currency based on   its value to all societies. No longer will people have to rely on their   Gov't's poor decision making with their monetary and fiscal   responsibilities. BTC has  its own intrinsic value outside of countries   FIAT systems.

The  Third   Dimension: BTC is for the planet! BTC is in its infant stage and  there   are challenges that will need to be addressed. BTC's use of energy is a   challenge that maybe Satoshi Nakamoto never figured in.  BTC will  not   survive with this negative attachment. Its doomed unless we address  this  challenge intelligently and responsibly. This is how we roll.  Which  brings  us back to the third dimension. Again,BTC is for the  planet, its  for society  and it's honest. We humans are too intelligent  to fall for  a hustle. The  current paradox will be lifted because  there are too  many positive attachments to this new human value system  that will prove  to be fair  and just for everyone. BTC will overcome  this high energy  use and use renewable energy in do time. Remember this  saying, ""There  are no flaws  in the truth unless the perception of the  truth is  flawed.""

Some  of the  misguided  brains want to go back to the gold standard. Think  about all  the raping  of the planet that went into the mining of Gold. Hmmmm,  there's   probably bad karma still attached to that value.

Where   do we, the  early investors fit in? Our HODL' makes up the board of   directors when  the final coin is mined. I like that! We will have a say   on the future of societies value system. I won't be here but if I own   (2) BTC's that =  2/21000000 of a world majority. There is value in  that  and I am glad to be accepted to the party.

Elon   it's time to come back to the BTC Party....Its all good you can use your influence to help find a solution to the energy consumption. BTC needs you!!!

This would be a great time to ""buy the dip"" according to many but I can't find good arguments to my question so I figured I'd ask here. 

How is this different from a ponzi scheme? People can only make money from people paying more in the future so any money I'd make is from someone buying hoping someone else would pay more, right? Not only that but money also dissapear from costs of mining and taxes. So for people to make 1 million other people have to spend more than that. How will this ever possibly change? According to information I can find a small amount of wallets contain a majority of all the Bitcoin so it doesn't sound like it's a wealth distributor either.

1621466881,Bitcoin,"Keep your eyes on the average priceI believe that it is important to tell my story for all the new ones who are now afraid.

&amp;#x200B;

I started in crypto in 2017, like many, I lost in the crash and all the crypto winter, however I kept buying, little by little I used DCA during all the bearish cycle, by 2019 I already had 46 BTC at an average cost of 11k.

 I did not sell in March, and after the big bull run, I kept buying now with greater force, and in this bull run, I obtained 71 BTC at an average cost of 17K.

4 million dollars change anyone's life, more so if you live in Mexico like me, I was tempted to sell but I didn't, I knew that the cycle could end suddenly and that I could get trapped, however I didn't do it just out of ambition, I did it because I am with my eyes on the next halving.

If you were trapped like me in the previous cycle and you are at a loss, do not panic, it will eventually rise, DCA to continue accumulating, and to wait for the next cycle.

See your holdings  in average price, that will help you have a different perspective, today I do not see that I lost 2 million dollars, for me, I am above 100% and that is what matters.

Personally, I still don't think the bullish cycle is over, but if so, I'm ready for it DCA and to wait for the next cycle, keep taking advantage of these low prices to improve your average price.

I said at 44k before what happened this morning, that I’m all in.  I am still all in and I’ve lost more than what I make in a year. If you’re deep in the red, look at bitcoins history. We’re no more likely to go to 20k in the coming weeks than we are back up to 50k in the coming months. I would say don’t invest more than you can afford to lose but I would be a hypocrite. What I will say though is that wether it be now or the next bull cycle, the coin will reach 100k.  Sell now, you’ll cry later (assuming you don’t buy back in lower).

Vitalik giving a billion away the other day brought this to the forefront of my thoughts again. 

One of the most beautiful moments of crypto generosity I've been privileged to witness is the pineapple project. 

http://pineapplefund.org/

It totally killed me with pride in crypto to watch those behind it just give unconditionally. 

You see, in all honestly I hope Cryptocurrency can make me rich one day... just so I can give it all away.

I have a dream and hope that one day.. together we all put crypto on the map for the sake of kindness and compassion to all our fellow human beings around the world.

Simply a day where registered charities post a link to their wallets on their official homepages for one day and we give.. like we've never given before.. hopefully setting record breaking 24hrs sums that echo around the world. We all have access to one of the greatest technologies to allow this to happen.


I believe the world will see goodness and power of crypto and want to adopt, giving everyone more to give away in an endless loop of love and admiration. 

The problem is, who am I but a mere spec of insignificance on the internet, that struggles to get their voice heard over a noisy room.. let alone a planet.

Crazily the only thing we need to make this happen... is a date and get the word out.

In my wildest dreams I can't see this coming true.

However in the slightest hope that it can I would like to put forward my mom's birthday, on behalf of your mom's and those all over the world.

The unconditional love a parent or guardian has for child is one of the most, if not thee most powerful forces in the world and I would love that feeling to be the same motivation.

Even if hypothetically this happens, I am sure there are many more investors ready to take China's place almost immediately, and I am sure the Chinese miners would move somewhere else to mine eventually. However, people act like ""China banned Bitcoin mining, we have a problem!"" Excuse my ignorance if it would be a problem, but I fail to see nothing more than network congestion and temporal higher fees per transactions in such a scenario of China banning Bitcoin mining."

Fast forward to 2021. 

-You still can’t use it for any transactions in your daily life. 

-Bitcoin is the farthest thing from stable. Even though the market cap has grown, it still drops 40% in a week just from a celebrity tweet. 

-Bitcoin, along with every other crypto, continuously proves to be completely useless as a stable currency or safe store of value to protect from inflation.

-Its terrible for the environment.

So if bitcoin is completely useless why do people still “invest” into it now?

Simply greed. 

People look at the charts and see how much bitcoin value has inflated over the past decade and they want to buy in to buy into it hoping someone will eventually come and pay more for it than they did. 

Most people owning bitcoin don’t care about inflation or or decentralized currency or any of that, they just want to get rich. They will sell quickly if Bitcoin trades sideway or down for any extended period of time.

The recent catalyst that got Bitcoin rolling in 2020 was inflation fear, but when inflation fear is gone later this year Bitcoin will crash and won’t recover for a long time. 

Tldr: the only thing holding up Bitcoin is greed. It’s a massively inflated asset that has no intrinsic value, has proven to be a failure on every level when compared with the original intent, and it is a net negative on society and the environment.

When I had any disposable cash on hand, I was scared Bitcoin was just going to explode and I would miss out, and so I'd immediately fomo it in. 

This, obviously, led to an average buy price up in the 50s.

I would then get upset and frustrated when it dipped because I wouldn't have any liquid cash to buy the dip. I was stuck in that cycle of always being nervous about not having enough, and then not being able to buy dips.

Well, **Bloody Wednesday cured me**. Being up that entire night, and then that morning when it all went down, watching the unbelievable manipulation where the whales attack and try to liquidate each other, seeing the China fud from 2017 come back as if it's a new thing, watching the price crash from 42k to 29k in an hour, and then recover just as fast, watching every exchange go down...

It showed me that, no, I ***don't*** have any idea where the price is going in the short term, nor should I expect to. Bitcoin's price isn't about the asset's intrinsic value. The price is a game, and I don't have the money or power to play it.

So that's it. I'll **dollar cost average** in from now on, slowly, over the course of a few weeks every time I have a chunk of cash I can invest. 

Even now, here's a question for you: when we get to 47k, are we going to the moon, or will we have one more capitulation crash back down into the 25s?

***No one knows.*** 

So I'll DCA in at 47k just like I'm doing now at 40k, and like I'll be doing from this point on, forever.

The acceptance of my own ignorance is liberating. I can finally breathe again."

The counter argument to bitcoin having such a volatile market is that it’s still in its infancy and will grow exponentially in the future. I fully believe this and am optimistically bullish. But this argument suggests that the volatility will decrease in the future as the market cap increases. That being said the whales that have already staked out their portion of Bitcoin will technically always own that percentage of the market? Unless they slip up and sell when others are buying causing them to cover/purchase higher. Not trying to claim this to be true, I’m mostly thinking out loud and wanting feedback."

&gt;""The  blockchain is a court if somebody tries to cheat you or if they go away  you know that the blockchain is always there to secure your  transaction...now it means that the underlying blockchain needs to be  secure but we know that Bitcoin right now is the most secure public  decentralized chain,  so fundamentally the blockchain functions as a  global decentralized judge that cannot be bribed.""

It makes bitcoin the most  secure network and as the foundational layer to be built upon, security  is paramount. So while you'll read other projects that are trying to  navigate balancing security, scalability, and decentralization, the  function of bitcoin is to be the version that refuses to compromise in  security and decentralization.

FED needs people to stop running away from fiat to slow down depreciation of currency. Also both China and FED do not need (too strong)    competition to their own digital currencies which are being implemented.

Anyway the death spiral for USD is unstoppable as once a central bank starts to print it cannot stop, so people and foreign investors are escaping   from fiat into properties , crypto (easy to slow down with  tweet!! or news about IRS..) and precious metals.

It is easy to pick on the messenger but be smart and hold some tangible   assets i.e silver or gold , why ? Because at the end of day, you cant   solve problem of debt by printing more money... so backing up fiat with   precious metals will be the only way to stop  (hyper)inflation. The   exchange will happen at very different rates..

I think they are essentially worried about how Bitcoin will impact banking in general, and their bank specifically.  They mentioned having me come in to give a talk to their team, and I was wondering if you all had any ideas for certain things I should mention. Bitcoin has been on my radar for the vast majority of the time it has existed, so I have a pretty wide understanding of it on many levels, and I'm one of the original bitcoiners, relating to the sort of anti-bankster sentiment as expressed in the genesis block. That being said, the folks at this little bank are local people who are very nice and decent people, and I have no particular desire to see their bank go the way of the dodo bird.

So this is kind of a question of ""where do I even start?"", but I am curious as to any ideas any of you might have on how to advise a small community bank on things they can do to stay in business and relevant in the face of Bitcoin continuing to grow as an asset class and mainly as an alternative to the legacy banking system.

ACCUMULATE.

The best time to buy is during the period after the crash straight through to the next halving.

**If You're Right:**

If you're right and the bull run is over, the sooner you start accumulating, the more you'll have when the next halving comes.

The biggest regret most hodlers have is not starting sooner.  Obviously, ""now"" is sooner than later.  So, start now, even if that just means stacking a few Sats.  Start.  Build.  Over time, watch your hodl add up.  When the next post-halving bull run begins, watch as everyone who regrets not getting in sooner looks at you with envy.

**If You're Wrong:**

I don't believe this bull run is over.  If I'm right, buying now means you're buying into this bull run at one heck of a discount.

Either way, you win.

I'm considering colocation mining through Compass, and I'm a bit concerned to purchase ASIC miners that I haven't seen and don't know how long they have been used.

They do give you the serial numbers for the miners you ""own"", but I don't know if that helps."

1621639092,Bitcoin,"Why staying around 40k is the best for BTC right nowAfter the ban of China, it would be clear that around 40k is the best for BTC now. It would clear up all the FOMO dudes who only eye on the short term profits. They would just make the BTC market even worse with all the FOMO and FUD news. No one who would care would be scared away, because all they see are people with get rich quick schemes on the market. Why would they join if all the news they read are about prices. Long gone the technical discussions. So let the FOMO shills die, then we can go back to fundamentals. If they are around for too long, It would never become a currency, because they only want to buy or sell, HODL... for profit. The currency is for trading for basic goods, nobody would hold on to USD for 10 years without spending a dime. They need to use it to trade for other goods, so it can fulfill the most basic requirement of a currency.  
How many posts here are about HODLING, DIAMOND HANDS, MOON... they are all damaging the real purpose of Bitcoin. Basically at this point, only the criminals are actually using the coins for its real purpose. If you do HODL forever, how can you beat the govs? You only strengthen their fiats because you would only sell Bitcoin to realize your gains, then use their fiats to buy stuffs.   
While 40k is still good to encourage the miners to make more BTC, it will be better when China actually ban mining. People just simply move to another place. China can't control the world, so as USA or any country. You have to remember the REAL PURPOSE of BTC. It is to: decentralize from central banks and to become a store of value TO TRANSACT."

1621725089,Bitcoin,"The Crypto Fear and Greed index is now at 12 (extreme fear). It has only dropped to this level five times in the past this cycle. So lets look at those dates, and look at the bitcoin price at that point and see whether each time presented a good buying opportunity. 

For those you aren't aware, the Crypto Fear and Greed index uses 5-6 measurements to assess the current sentiment of the market and then rates that level of emotion on a scale of 1 to 100. 1 is extreme fear and 100 is extreme greed.

Those measurements are objective of course - they look at volatility, social media, momentum, dominance, google trends and (now paused) surveys.

Here is the link to the site, you can look at the chart, click ""max"" and you will see a movement of the index since the start of 2018.

[https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)

In theory, the idea should be that in cases of extreme fear, the market is terrified and panic selling, and it is a good buying opportunity. When the market is in a state of extreme greed, people are getting extreme fomo and buying regardless of the elevated prices. Hopefully you get the picture.

There is a lot of movement in the chart but it is the extreme fear and greed regions that interest me - specifically around the region of 80 plus or 20 below.

Today the fear and greed index is at 12 - not a record low but very close and certain the lowest for a very long time. And yet the price is at $37,500 - still historically extremely high.

Looking at the index to date, there are only five other times in the past where the index has plunged below 20. I thought it would be helpful to look at that regions, what was happening and the price at that point, and to think of those as historical buying points:

**6 February 2018 - Index Score: 8. BTC Price $6,852.**

This is probably the point at which there was a realization we truly were in a bear market, with bitcoin already down around 65% since its top. While buying at this point (the start of a 1 year bear market) is not exactly enticing, that price was more or less the average price for most of the year. Certainly not a bad entry point if you had resisted the temptation to buy in the entire bull market of 2017.

**1 April 2018 - Index Score 16. BTC Price $6,975**

Around March of 2018 was a bit of a ""dead cat bounce"" with the price recovering to nearly $12,000. Many people breathed a sigh of relief, portfolios turned green and it seemed like the bear market was over. Nope. Bitcoin immediately crashed right back down again to prices similar to February. Hence a moment of extreme fear.

Again, this wasn't a particularly bad buying point historically, having just avoiding fomo of the surge in bitcoin up to that much higher price level.

**25 November 2018 - Index Score 9. BTC Price $3,895**

Now we're talking. This was the time of the infamous ""hash wars"" when BCH forked and the markets plunged into absolute chaos. Bitcoin crashed through its $6,000 support level and halved in price.

This was an absolute buying opportunity - perhaps the opportunity of a lifetime, with an average price around this level for six months. Happy to say I bought right through but not enough. Each buy at the time seemed painful, and it was embarassing at times for people to even know you were in crypto.

Also recall that at $3,100 very few people were calling this the bottom (shout out to Smart Contractor from twitter here who picked it). Many had buy ladders down to $1.3k, and it seemed a fall to at least the mid $2,000s was obvious. A little bit like those all calling for $25k right now.

**22 August 2019 - Index Score 5. BTC $10,124**

This one might feel like a bit of an anomaly, but in some ways it feels quite similar to today. Bitcoin had just ripped from $4k to around $14k and the bull run was on. After a short period, bitcoin fell sharply and the price started to collapse downwards. I think ""5"" is a bit extreme for fear but this was the realization that the bull market might be over. For the next six months, the bitcoin price let out steam down to $6.5k (aside from one day when President Xi managed to pump us back to $10,300 - oh for the days when China would actually pump our prices).

So not a great buying spot, but better than FOMOing at $14k and historically still not bad.

**13 March 2020 - Index Score 10. BTC $5,142**

I don't think this one needs much explanation. The corona effect was sharp and deadly, with the bitcoin price absolutely collapsing quickly. Again, I don't think we have any debate that this was one hell of a buying opportunity. Even more if you had cash to deploy in the weekend. One person I know bought ETH at $85 or so at that point. And there are some people suggesting the charts today are quite similar to this. Hmmmm.

**Today. Index Score 12. BTC $37,753**

What can we say? I think the terror here is real. But at the same time a billion dollars of stable coins just flooded into binance and bifinex, and funding rates have switched negative. If we look to the panic in November 2018, this was the start of a six month period of hell - worst case scenario we might get something like that, but also recall that in November the worst was already nearly over.

1621723981,Bitcoin,"In a world where all bitcoins are mined and the price has become stable what would the value of one Bitcoin be?I’m curious what members of this sub think the “intrinsic value” of a Bitcoin would be if all the predictions that are usually made here come true.  So I’m imagining a world where fiat currencies are either volatile or steadily devaluing.  In this world all the bitcoins that could ever exist have been mined, so accounting for lost bitcoins we can say there are 17 million of them in circulation and the “value” of them is agreed upon and stable.  Is there some kind of set value you see it being worth? 

Since it can’t appreciate in terms of “real value” indefinitely (except in relation to a declining fiat currency) what is one worth in your opinion?  Ten years of unskilled manual labor?  One acre of oceanfront property in Malibu?  10000 cows?  Could you peg it to some other kind of finite resource, like 1000 pounds of gold?

1621722799,Bitcoin,"Banks use more energy than the entire crypto market. Here’s my argument.To put it in context, you must think about how much energy the banking industry consumes. Bank of America has a total of approximately 9,600 locations. Wells Fargo has 8,000. Chase has 4,700. These don’t include their corporate buildings and headquarters, or entire city blocks that are entire banking districts. Not to mention, they aren’t the only banks worldwide. If you take a deep dive into the energy they consume to operate on a day to day basis, from electricity, to waste, water and paper consumption, and of course moving money to all of these locations several times a day (Brinks), I think without even doing the math, it’s obvious what consumes more energy.

1621722701,Bitcoin,"The more Bitcoin matures, the less it will be susceptible to market manipulation.Hey everyone. I want to share my thoughts about the recent market movements and maybe also convince you thst you shouldn't be too worried. Bitcoin is still the same, it's chugging along, one block every ten minutes, and there will ever be 21M BTC. 

Crashes like the one we've just experienced are largely driven by very very *very* big whales that can move the markets and have been always performing coordinated operations to play the markets, since the early days of Bircoin. Sometimes it's helpful to think of whales as not many different individuals that compete against each other but rather one single entity (of course they're really not) that have aligned interest: to buy your precious coins at a cheaper price. It's how they play and its often how they became whales.

Whales are a little but like Psy Ops: they are so wealthy that they can produce and spread FUD, engineered news, and time these attacks precisely over the course of weeks and months, causing market cycles like the one we've just experienced. The reason why these tactics work, is because humans are psychological beings and we all act very similarly, i.e., some kind of herd mentality instantly makes millions of people switch their outlook from overly optimistic and greedy (""wooohoo Bitcoin is at ATH, we're going to the mooooon!"") to being terrified and acting out of a position of fear: 

""omg, it has already fallen so much and its probably going to fall even more! Better sell now than having to carry even heavier bags...?? Guys?? Can you please tell me what I should do?? Youtube?? Twitter??? Anyone??"" 

&gt; China bans bitcoin (again) 

*dump eet*

Sounds familiar?

The reason why I'm optimistic is that, the more Bitcoin matures and becomes widely accepted and recognized as a safe store of value (which it most probably will succeed in), the less likely your average Bitcoiner, like you and me, will even think about having to sell it. ""Sell it? Sell it for what? For a worse asset like fiat? Or gold?"" will be what the future holder of bitcoin will hopefully think. 

This is what people mean by ""the more an asset matures, the less volatile it becomes"". When Bitcoin concludes its maybe decades long phase of price discovery and finds some sensible value to denomiate the world's wealth faithfully, it will become a lot more stable in value. We won't be experiencing these ridiculous events anymore in this intensity, in which a highly leveraged market of millions of autistic apes (that's what they call themselves, right?) and paper hands will be movable by the switch of a button, a few tweet campaigns, some well-placed headlines, and other shady methods.

As I understand it, one of the key differences between non-taproot and Taproot with Schnorr signatures is the obfuscation of transaction and smart contract types.

The reason why I think this is a big deal, is because controlling interests, such as governments (the US, specifically) have spent an exorbitant amount of money and time building and acquiring tools to surveil bitcoin transactions and its network. Taproot flips this on its head, indirectly. 

This is huge because LN transactions are all done off-chain until the channel is closed. Meaning, no one can spy on you. A big hurdle to this was the fact that opening a LN channel was identifiable prior to taproot. After taproot, it will look like a normal transaction. 

Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it's a coincidence that the US government may not have been worried until now. I'm not claiming the US is behind the FUD, they just have the most to lose."

1621812393,Bitcoin,"Regarding whales, psychology, and greed. And we can trust greed.People seem to think that this is already the bear market. Yes, maybe it is.

But lets forget technicals, lets forget fundamentals, lets focus on human psychology, especially greed. Greed is always transparent. Greed is the one sin we can trust where afflicted people act in their self own interest.

Think about it this way - the first 2 cycles people with enough power (whales with enough coins to move markets) started to realize that the halvening presents a pump and dump opportunity. so they did that. around 375 days range in each cycle they did. and they did both. their money increase 5x-10x and made the late buyers become 4 year bagholders.

the last cycle, 2017, they further realize that they can extend the cycle even further, adding another last leg up. they did exactly that, extended the cyle for 170++ more days. not only 372 days now, its 500++ days.

so now think, why would they retrace back to 375 days only? (now) when they know they can get another leg up. enter first scenario. no leg up? they settle on their profits, wait 4 years doing nothing and whatever money and btc they have now stays dormant. the whales in the know already bought in from $9000 and sold at $50k-60k. 5x ish. thats good. but is that enough? maybe. but thats it, now 4 years of nothing?

or do they think, hey, theres still pent up momentum, last cycle we extended a leg up, why not do it again? enter scenario 2, a bonus round to yet make another 3-5x wealth before another dump. why not?

now which scenario is more possible?

as much i would like to think its the former, i trust in greed and i believe they will try their best to do the latter.

TL;DR:

if there is one thing we can trust about greed in humanity, it is that every big player will act on their own self interest. bear markets and periods of downtime without volatility dont make the whales money. volatile markets and halvening cycles and up and down legs make them money. they will try to extend this again for another leg up. because thats where the money is. and there is still a goldmine in another leg up where they can still make a shit ton of money. so why let the music stop now?"

1621807238,Bitcoin,"CVE-2021-31876 is NOT a Vulnerability ; This Behavior is Hard CodedRecently there was a CVE published online for Bitcoin under the code 'CVE-2021-31876'. 

For those that don't know, 'CVE' stands for ""Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures"". The United States gov't alongside the Mitre Corp. and others host a website that essentially keeps a database of newly found vulnerabilities over time for public awareness purposes. 

### The Recently Submitted Bitcoin CVE is Not an Actual Vulnerability

I'm not sure whether this is bullish or bearish, but I'm 98% certain that whomever submitted this CVE (Core devs?) erroneously reported that the protocol was not properly ejecting transactions from the mempool based on certain pre-coded conditions dictated by BIP125. 

I went through the protocol documentation (referencing 'Mastering Bitcoin' and relevant accompanying code), and will confirm in this post that the protocol is actually behaving the way that it should in the example scenario outlined in the CVE. 

### Quick Look at CVE-2021-31876

You can find the URL to that CVE here: &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-31876&gt;

Below is the full text of the CVE: 

&gt; *""Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending an unconfirmed parent with nSequence &lt;= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction.""* 

That paragraph is a bit dense, so let's ""humanize"" the situation a bit by creating a mock situation involving you and your friends (Johnny and Amy):


1. When you send a normal Bitcoin transaction, the ""parent"" is the transaction you received that gave you the balance necessary to be able to send that TX. 

2. Let's say Johnny sends you 1 Bitcoin because he's a great friend. You now have 1 BTC (you had absolutely nothing before - so Johnny blesed you)

3. But you owe Amy money - specifically, 1 Bitcoin (life sucks). So you send 1 BTC to Amy. 

At this point, two transactions have occurred. 

a) Johnny sent you 1 BTC (**parent**)

then

b) You sent Amy 1 (**child**) 

Now to understand the concept being outlined in the CVE, let's revise our scenario slightly. 

1. Let's say Johnny is lazy but he trusts you with his life because you're an honest, upstanding person. So Johnny hits you up and says, ""Dude here's my private key, just send yourself 1 BTC"". You say, 'Okay Johnny!' 

2. Using Johnny's wallet, you sign a transaction to yourself. 

3. But you **decide not to broadcast that signed transaction immediately**. You save it in a document on your desktop or something. 

4. You still owe Amy in this scenario (sorry!) and she still wants her money...or else. So you create your 1 BTC transaction to Amy. 

5. You use that signed transaction from Johnny as the input for your transaction to Amy. Even though you haven't broadcasted it yet, you still have all of the necessary information to craft such a transaction. 

This transaction is actually considered **valid** and **standard**. 

&gt; *Why?* 

Because the process of creating transactions is not interactive. In other words, you can craft a transaction entirely offline (assuming you have the knowledge of the necessary inputs for the transaction etc.). 

There are no checks in Bitcoin that determines whether a transaction is valid or not on the basis of whether it has been included in the chain or not. Instead, Bitcoin assesses whether you have met the necessary conditions to spend a transaction (i.e. ,SHA256+ripemd160(pubkey) &amp; match that with the byte push, run the rest of the stack and validate the signature correlates with the raw Bitcoin pubkey you submitted as an input to the stack). 

In this example, the transaction you're broadcasting is technically valid because you used Johnny's wallet to sign the 1 BTC over to you. And when you crafted  your TX to Amy, you used that same signed transaction as the input to your transaction to her. 

Only issue here though is that Johnny's TX was never broadcasted, so even though the transaction is validly constructed - its referring to a transaction that does not yet currently exist. 

From here, I'm going to refer back to the CVE and isolate how it claims that Bitcoin behaves. Then I'm going to point out the protocol specification that states otherwise and explain a bit more how things work in that type of situation. 

### CVE Erroneously Claims That the Child Transaction Should be Replaceable

Specifically it states that the unconfirmed child transaction spending an ""unconfirmed parent"" should be replaceable ""because there is inherited signaling by the child transaction."" 

From here, we get the supposed identified CVE, which is the claim that, ""The actual [PreChecks](file:///home/libre/.ephemeral/Bitcoin/Technical/PreChecks.txt) implementation does not enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the unconfirmed child transaction."" 

This is how the mempool **should** act in this situation. 

So essentially, they're stating that there can be multiple ""duplicate"" transactions (double spends) in the mempool - which the CVE identifies as incorrect behavior. This oversight is understandable since this is how it would **usually work**. 

But as we'll see in the next section from 'Mastering Bitcoin', that this specific situation actually triggers an exception in the protocol that dictates special handling. 

### Bitcoin is Supposed to Behave This Way

Don't ask me how I know this, but this exact situation is actually outlined in, 'Mastering Bitcoin' (really), where it is confirmed that this is how Bitcoin is supposed to behave. 

Here's the link: &lt;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/ch05.html&gt;

Specifically, it says:

&gt; ""When a chain of transactions is transmitted across the network, they don't always arrive in the same order. Sometimes, the child might arrive before the parent. In that case, the nodes that see a child first can see that it references a parent transaction that is not yet known.""

In other words, that child transaction is referencing an unconfirmed parent...same situation as described in the CVE. 

**The chapter goes on to state**: 

&gt; ""Rather than reject the child, they put it in a temporary pool (not the mempool) to await the arrival of its parent and propagate it to every other node. The pool of transactions without parents is known as the orphan transaction pool."" 

Many people have never heard of the 'orphan transaction pool', but it does indeed exist (for transactions that fit the attributes we described above). 

'Mastering Bitcoin' wraps this section up making it clear that the transaction **does evenutally resolve**: 

&gt; ""Once the parent arrives, any orphans that reference the UTXO created by the parent are released from the pool, revalidated recursively, and then the entire chain of transactions can be included in the transaction pool, ready to be mined in a block.""

### Unpacking What We Read Above

The most important takeaway from what we read above is that the parent must be spent before the unconfirmed child - but if we're in a situation where the child refers to an unconfirmed parent that is referenced as an otherwise valid input, then any 'double spend attempts' that also reference the same (unconfirmed) parent transaction will **not be ousted from the mempool** in the same way that a double spend referencing a **confirmed** parent transaction would.

Beyond this, its also worth remembering that **this does not mean that the parent must already be confirmed before the child** (confusing, I know - stick with me). 

#### Explaining a Bit Further

Whenever a new block is submitted by miners, they typically contain a ton of transactions, right? While the order of the TXs doesn't matter, **there is an order to those TXs**. So a miner **can** mine a valid block that contains a previously unspent parent transaction **and** its unspent child. 

The only caveat is that the parent must be included **before** the child transaction, canonically, within that block.

### When Parent is Spent, All Duplicates are Immediately Purged

Once nodes receive a block that validly spends the parent TX, the normal rules for handling attempted double-spend unconfirmed transactions kick in. So all transactions in the ""orphan transaction pool"" that attempted to spend that same unspent child transaction (whose parent and/or itself just got confirmed) will be expelled by nodes since this is now an unequivocal flagrant double spend attempt. 

### Conclusion - CVE Should Be Rescinded

To be honest, I'm not sure if this has happened with a CVE (where it was issued, then later retracted). 

I understand why Core came to the conclusion that this was a CVE (never heard of an 'orphan transaction pool' before I read that passage in 'Mastering Bitcoin', but lo and behold it does).

**Perhaps This is Bullish**

This will undoubtedly be great for at least some folks to hear since it will alleviate the stress that some may feel knowing that there was an active CVE for Bitcoin. 

**Flipside** 

While the behavior is not incorrect, the conclusions that the developers came to about it being adverse for LN implementation does stand. 

So this is more of a pyrrhic victory - depends on how one looks at it. 

At the end of the day nothing about this situation is catastrophic for Bitcoin. I do think that this behavior should be investigated first and studied before unilaterally changing it since we now know that this is not incorrect behavior."

2- I'm busy with other problems in my life for the past 10 years, hence crypto didn't impact me much) .

3- Crypto is not my source of income.

4- I didn't learn, core TA and FA yet so when things go against logic, I'm not surprised at all.

5- I didn't have high hopes.

6- I was in a loss for a year and half :).

7- I hodled USDT for 10 months in 2020, so I don't Mind hodling crypto in a bear market.

8- I can’t express feelings since a long time (walking zombie).

9 - I believe in destiny and that everything happens for a reason.

10- past year I wasn't busy with prices I learned a lot about crypto history and listened to more than 8 podcasts.

11- I always lived frugally and saved and now I learned that I need to invest a portion of my money.

12 - I naturally don't enjoy money. I'm a content person and don't like to spend a lot.

13- I gave out a lot of money to support family and friends and never got the money back. So, I'm OK in spending some on crypto.

14- I have read, listened and watched crypto OGs and leaders. You will understand the space and Tech, not only the money.

15- time spent in learning crypto and investing adds to you as a person and teach you self-control (intangible benefits).

16 - take every event in your life as a learning, look at the positive aspect.

17 - money won't make you a happier person.

18 - you won't take the money with you when you die.

I'm still very bullish on crypto that's why I'm hodling

For those who aren't familiar -- DeFi is the new financial system being built around crypto.  It allows users lend/borrow, trade, and stake assets all on the blockchain.  Right now the only way to get access to the space is to download a private wallet.

I'm wondering if anyone on here be interested in using a hosted wallet rather than a private one? For instance, would you use a website that looked/felt like CoinBase but was powered by DeFi. This would include the ability to trade more tokens, to lend/borrow, and to stake.

I imagine experienced vet's are probably happy w/ private wallets, but maybe there are some new users on here who would feel more comfortable w/ this?  I think we would insure the wallets against hacking for the first few years while we are building up our credibility."

1621900004,Bitcoin,"Bubble caused by raging bots on exchangeI sent Coinbase a support ticket when I noticed trading bots creating endless buy/sell orders which netted the transactions a negative profit and still still no response from them and wanted to share with the community. I opened the notify them yesterday at 9am, but the bots were disabled around 1pm. I wanted to keep it privately between us, but since they are not are responding to me I wanted to share this info with you all. 

Dear Coinbase,

These trading bots on your exchange and other major exchanges needs to be stopped, before its too late. These bots are designed to do one thing…. to make a small profit by creating new buy and sell orders instantaneously 24x7. It usually not a problem when the major exchanges are busy, but lately… it hasn’t been and all of these bots are causing major disruption and main reason why the crypto market has been so volatile. I understand its fair trade and legal, but when there are thousands of these bots submitting hundreds buy/sell order per minute to profit very small gains, there will always be more sell orders than buy orders; and is the main reason why it has been so volatile lately. I also know Coinbase is now a publicly traded company and the business makes their revenue based on each transactions and I would like to see the company succeed too. I’m just concern with the amount of bots running 24x7, this network of bots will eventually collapse the entire crypto market. Not only they submit buy/sell order instantly for small gains, but they can also hedge buy/sell orders against other exchanges at different rates, set to only run during certain up or down swing, program to the exact hash and profit percentage, etc…. This past week, the only time the market is not volatile, is when these bots weren't running at full capacity. Since its a service that CoinBase provides, would it be possible to limit their API transaction rate? I’m not asking to remove them entirely, but would like to find a solution on how to handle your bot api features, before its too late. The crypto community are doing their job reinvesting into the market, but all of these bots are eating up all the slight gains for small profit. The owners probably haven’t had the time been reconfigured yet, to reflect the 70% less purchasing voluming on the exchanges; so these bots are running wild creating more percise sell orders than what the exchange is getting in buy orders... which leads to.... you know. Any suggestion you may have would be grateful.

1621895846,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is the adult in the roomJust some musing on narratives and counter-narratives around Bitcoin. 


Its no secret that Bitcoin leads the market - it goes up, everything else goes up. It goes down, everything else goes down. This is because its where all the mature market participants park the bulk of their investment (last to flight). These are people who are trying to store millions in value for a decade, not to be confused with people trying to turn 100 bucks into their first million (first to flight).


There's something that I don't think too many people understand. Suppose there is a crypto store of value in a decade (there might not be, but suppose there is) - Bitcoin is the only possible one that could be that store of value. A chief criticism of crypto is that there's no supply cap with so many altcoins coming online. This would be true if something flipped Bitcoin in market cap and stayed there. But nothing has done this, yet. This is critical to understand. If something does this, lots of money will leave the space because the narrative will have broken. But also important to understand, _unless_ something does this, the hyper-bitcoinization narrative is intact and multimillion dollar per-Bitcoin prices are realistic or even probable. If something flips Bitcoin, there's no good reason to assume something else won't flip the flipper, too. _Until that happens_, there's no reason to think BTC won't be worth millions.


Some people really think there's some world where, who knows, XYZ coin flips BTC as ""the new money"" and the whole market doesn't trend quickly to zero. Wildly unlikely. This whole space may fail, but BTC is the only one that has a remote chance of being money. Which is a big deal. Imagine some altcoin creates a new world computer? Neat. Money is half of every transaction. They are still orders of magnitude apart in their implications. If ETH does free smart contracts, that unlocks a lot of cool stuff and will have a lot of competitors for market share. If Bitcoin becomes the new money, it becomes a national security threat for nation states not to own huge stockpiles of it. Totally different ballparks in projections of appreciation."

1621895614,Bitcoin,"Pundi X Mainet Update😍Function X Mainnet aka f(x)Core will be feature rich. Tons of things.

Low fees, high speed.

21 validators in initial months, hosted by team for security, will open up for public in stages, first stage will be for f(x) Cloud beta testers.

Tokens can be delegated/staked into validators to earn block tokens. Low fees.

Cross chain capabilities. Users are able to swap back and forth their ERC-20s ($PUNDIX, $FX, $DAI, $LINK etc) into and out of Function X Mainnet. This dual way flow ensures liquidity and user control.

The ERC-20s when swapped into Mainnet will help earn yields in various forms - savings, collaterization, etc. In collaterised form, the collaterised value will be pegged to a $1 worth of fxUSD so that there is a price point reference.

We are prioritizing a DEX but also one that is competitive and have a different market fit than that of Uni/Sushi etc. More on this later, and aim will take into account how to create value for $FX and $PUNDIX tokens.

Function X is multi-chain and cross-chain. Cross chain connects to other chains such as Ethereum. Multi chain means internally we will launch different chains and they are all connected by f(x) Core. The multi chains are created by team and third party businesses (banks, fintech, other crypto projects, yourself). The creation criteria will involve holding our tokens to create value.

Oracle pricing. Hopefully most if not all assets price reference can be via oracle, this is something we are working with Chainlink and others.

First use case of the multi-chain feature will be connecting XPOS and creating a decentralised version. The use case is big and warrants its own article.

A lot more feature really, but enough for now.

I don’t want to overcommit but these features are likely to all be implemented, but again judging from recent newbie flood into our tokens, I need to emphasis DYOR."

1621891444,Bitcoin,"It was an orchestrated assault on your bitcoin... do not forget next timeJust a reminder of what a coincidence it was that we had 4-5 massive FUD bombs dropped within days of eachother. They literally brought the boat back.

One day later billionaires are endorsing bitcoin again after their bags got stuffed. 

Stop worshipping ANYBODY and stop being such a fuckin pussy of a human by following their every word. Elon will return to bitcoin and Micheal Saylor WILL eventually turn on us.... they are in talks right now as this is being posted. They want your coins and these billionaires could care less about you and your family.

1621891233,Bitcoin,"Comparing 2021 vs 2018 mining efficiency and energy consumptionBest efficiency in 2021: 90 TH/s  at 3,1 kW

Best efficiency in 2018: 14 TH/s at 1,3 kW (or 90 TH/s at 8,36 kW for apples to apples comparison)  


Network hashrate in 2021: 150 million TH/s

Network hashrate in 2018: 50 million TH/s

&amp;#x200B;

If all miners used best available technology today:   
150 million/90=1 666 666,7 miners  
1 666 666,6\*3,1 kW\*8760 hours=45,26 TWh yearly energy  


If all miners used best available technology in 2018:  
50 million/90=555 555,6 miners  
555 555,6\*8,36 kW\*8760 hours=40,69 TWh yearly energy  


It's clear that energy does not necessarily follow hash rate growth. In fact it could actually be close constant despite the growth. This trend will probably continue. Obviously not all miners use the best tech available at all times so actual numbers wil be bigger for both examples, but the two examples use the best for each period as a comparative estimate. Both in 2021 and in 2018 old miners become unprofitable so it's not an unreasonable comparison."
1621891112,Bitcoin,"Some questions regarding btc's future... I just read Vijay's awesome article about the bullish case for bitcoin at [https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1](https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1) (and also updated at 

the saylor academy bitcoin course website: [https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=30719](https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=30719))

And now I see the book is finally coming ([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-book-launch/pledge/new?clicked\_reward=false](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/boyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-book-launch/pledge/new?clicked_reward=false))

I am looking forward to receive the book, but in the mean time I want to ask the following questions that I have after reading the article:

1.

One of the main advantages of bitcoin over fiat that the author has stressed was *Censorship-resistance.,* which was defined as

*""how difficult is it for an external party such as a corporation or state to prevent the owner of the good from keeping and using it. Goods that are censorship-resistant are ideal to those living under regimes that are trying to enforce capital controls or to outlaw various forms of peaceful trade*

I agree, according to that definition, bitcoin wins hands down. However, as we have seen the last few weeks, bitcoin is, at least at the moment, extremely vulnerable to the opinion of few people (Elon Musk's tweets, some news on the media, etc). Say whatever about fiat, no news will swing it 20% up or down within hours.

In the article, the volatility of btc was explained that btc's volatility will decrease with adoption. Can we also assume that this ease of manipulation will diminish with adoption?

2. 

 (This is somehow related the previous one) regarding whales and how they implicitly make the system centralized. I mean, look at some of the major voices of bitcoin at the moment: Michael Saylor, Michael Novogratz, Mark Cuban, etc. All are multi-billionaires. They are not the 1%, they are the 0.0001%, among the top few hundred richest persons in the world. And all major banks and investment firms are now encouraging high networth individuals to jump on the crypto ship. And these will be the guys that will control the fate of the bitcoin in the future, not the retail investors like most of the redditors here, the majority of whom do not even own one full bitcoin, and not the ""unbanked masses"" towards which the decentralization was supposed to bring financial freedom and possibilities.

Can we still say bitcoin is centralized when it is turning out this way? Can we really say that bitcoin has succeeded knowing that were are just repeating some of the main downside of the fiat economy, i.e. inequality?

3)

 I would also have liked to see a ""day in the life"" sort of scenario describing a future world where fiat has disappeared (how the economics of that future will look like). Will there really be no inflation but deflation instead? Do we evolve into an economy where instead of constant growth to compensate for the inflation by increasing the GDP? How will work, wage, etc will be impacted in such a future (will we finally be able to achieve the 10-15 hr work week that we have been promised almost a century ago by economists, will btc facilitate a future with a UBI, etc...)?"

So fiat currency is inherently inflationary, we print and print and devalue our currency which forces price levels to go up right. 

If we constantly force price levels up, and if cryptocurrency hits a plateu in value, wouldn’t crypo be experiencing the side effects of inflation still?

Say “x” crypto is worth 100$ and its proved to be the stable price for it. And milk goes from 4$ a bag to 7$ a bag over “y”time, our crypto is worth less tommorow than it is today as long as feds keep printing money and causing price levels to rise, right?

Does anyone here use a service or platform they recommend? 

Is it better to just use whatever trading platform and figure out my own? 

Would love to trust professional crypto nerds to ‘diversify’... otherwise I’ll just keep stacking sats as my only move. 

Forbes makes it sounds like I have to start one myself-

‘To hold cryptocurrency in a retirement account, the account owner must make the investments through an LLC (limited liability company). The steps to take are as follows:
1. Establish and fund a self-directed IRA with a custodian of such retirement plans.

2. Form and register an LLC, which will be 100% owned by the IRA and, therefore, carry the same tax-advantaged status as the IRA. The income and expenses related to the assets will flow through the IRA LLC as required by the Internal Revenue Service. Cryptocurrency is considered property for federal tax purposes by the IRS, but because the assets are owned by a retirement account, gains are tax advantaged.
3. Using funds from the IRA, the LLC opens a business checking account (an IRA LLC is also referred to as a “checkbook IRA”). The checkbook puts the account owner in full control of the transaction (checkbook control), which is made simply by writing a check or wiring funds. The funds in the IRA LLC’s business checking account are for the sole purpose of investing in the digital assets (or any other alternative assets allowed through self-direction).
4. Open an account on a cryptocurrency exchange in the name (and tax number) of the IRA LLC. In addition to being purchased or traded on exchange platforms, digital assets may also be purchased through brokers or by investing in a fund that holds various digital currencies through private placement. In effect, the IRA purchases shares or directly invests as a limited partner.’ 

I’m used to using as basic and simple a platform as Acorns. Im not going to start my own LLC. Thoughts?"

2. I manage to get 12% return every year to my clients, which is better than the S&amp;P 500 yearly returns!
3. Look at this Visa card, this is exactly the same thing, digital payment!!

1. We are still early AF;
2. People have biases, including myself. But he just couldn't admit that something could disrupt the way he would do business;
3. The average Joe still thinks that crypto is just Bitcoin and that it has no utility;

5. HODL.

1621979077,Bitcoin,"Change my view: I am against Bitcoin, and the pinned website did not sufficiently address my concerns.*Before I start, this post is for civil discussion about Bitcoin only. Don't mention your altcoins in the comments and don't use logical fallacies (For example, in one part of this post, I mention that bitcoin fees are too high. Don't respond with x altcoin also has high fees). I'll structure this post in sections with titles written in bold.*

**Bitcoin's electricity usage is nothing compared to banks or gold mining.**

My counter argument for banks is that banks provide many more services than bitcoin, including in person locations, loans, salaries for millions of people, and so on. Even if bitcoin becomes the dominant currency of the world, many of these services will still have to exist.

Regarding gold mining, I agree that gold mining for the purpose of having a store of value is wasteful and needs to be toned down. However, replacing one inefficient use of energy with another is not a good idea.

**Bitcoin's electricity usage is worth it, especially for people in countries with hyperinflation.**

If bitcoin was to switch over to PoS, the benefits would not vanish. There are arguments that PoS is insecure which I'll address below.

**Bitcoin's mining gives it value.**

According to the endthefud website, the annual salary of miners is under seven billion a year. Considering bitcoin's one trillion market cap during peak times, that's nothing. Furthmore, such ridiculous amounts of money put into mining can make bitcoin *less secure.* If a massive crash, worse than 2018, however unlikely, was to happen, mining would quickly become unprofitable and hashrate would drop. On top of that, the mining machines would then be sold for pennies on the dollar, making a 51 attack feasible.

**PoS is inherently insecure.**

One argument is that proof of stake chains have forked many times. Those mostly happened when PoS was new, and with advances in the technology, such concerns are quickly becoming a thing of the past.

Another argument is that slashing (the process of taking away someone's stake for improper behavior) is ineffective because malicious actors will not enforce the punishment on themselves. This is not an effective argument because the slashing is meant to punish small scale attacks, and in order for an attack to overwhelm the network, control of a vast majority of the staked amount is needed, and with a large market cap crypto, this is just as difficult, if not more difficult, as acquiring enough hashrate to do a 51 attack. 

Even if a user amasses a majority, it is against their best interests to carry out such an attack because the value will likely drop afterwards, and if all else fails, a fork reversing the attack may occur. There is already a precedent for this: after ""The Dao"" was hacked, ethereum hard forked, reversing the attack, and the new chain was accepted by the community as the canonical chain.

**Bitcoin transaction fees are not a problem because lightning exists.**

Lightning requires a channel to be opened and bitcoin to be reserved, which requires an on chain transaction and the accompanying fee. It also requires that the recipient be online. Furthermore, it is not accepted everywhere and requires more programming than just accepting main chain payments, and adds more complexity for the end user. Remember that what seems simple to you is quite complicated to many others.

**Conclusion**

I've presented the reasons why I dislike bitcoin. Let's see if my view gets changed."

1621978089,Bitcoin,"PSA: Nodes have more control over the protocol than minersI see a lot of exaggerated reactions to the news that some rich folks are talking about some green mining cartel. It leads me to believe many here don't understand who decides what makes Bitcoin, well, Bitcoin.

The gist of it is this: if they want to self-impose some rules regarding mining (more specifically: the energy source used), let them go ahead, because it won't have an effect on the protocol level. 

Bitcoin is the term used for many different parts of the Bitcoin machine. It describes both the ecosystem, the token, the network, the protocol, etc. Bitcoin is not something straightforward, which makes it so difficult to explain in laymens terms. Rather it is a balanced act of several different concepts, technical, economical and political.

The role of a miner is very different from that of a node. Unfortunately many here fail to understand this difference and attribute way too much power and control to the miners, while it is in fact the nodes that ultimately decide what it is we call Bitcoin. Attempts by miners to assert control over the blockchain have happened in the past, and they did not end in favor of the miners. Any attempt this time around to assert control through politics and legislation won't work either. 

Any miner can decide which transactions to include or not include in his block. But one single miner can't mine all the blocks. If the green mining cartel on the other hand decides to fork with their 'clean version' of the blockchain, whatever that means, they are free to do so, but they won't have an economic majority behind them, which means they will lose money, because they don't get to decide what Bitcoin is, nodes do.

tl;dr run a node, read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos, chuckle at this meaningless green cartel mining crap, good night"

Look at what they've been doing to Julian Assange. Look at what they do to dissidents in Western nations. In order for Bitcoin to be a truly free money, we need to make sure the bulk of the mining is done outside of Western nations, away from America's sphere of influence. That means Iran, North Korea, China, and Russia. If most of the mining is done in Western Europe and the US, we should expect to see transaction censorship become the norm."

1622076191,Bitcoin,"Capitulation (The Other One)With China (once again) cracking down on Bitcoin there is much talk about Chinese miners getting ready to move out of the country.  Obviously this isn't new, we've seen similar things before though more focused on exchanges now the focus appears to be on mining.

Supposedly China controls 65% of hashrate:   [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1200477/bitcoin-mining-by-country/)

I've been keeping an eye on global hashrate:  [https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate)

It's showing hashrate down to around 140mm TH/s out of a high of 180mm (-22%).  If my pseudo math is correct, we'd see it drop to 63mm TH/s if all Chinese miners just stopped (yes this wouldn't happen as they'd just start moving but this takes time).  And what's interesting is we are starting to see a (very) small rise in hashrate once again.

So here's my point.  What if China capitulates?  They come to the conclusion that Bitcoin and other forms of decentralized finance are here to stay (and will only grow) and that they must not cede their share of the industry dominance.  I think we're at an inflection point here guys and it'll be hard for them to hide their final decision.  We will either see the hashrate continue trending down as miners spin down and move their operations to another country -OR- they'll capitulate and form a policy of fostering this emerging market.  Now wouldn't that be a hard pill for them to swallow?

Either way, exciting times.  I personally feel that a Chinese capitulation would catapult the price of Bitcoin up however I would almost prefer they cede (mining related) dominance because I see Bitcoin as a form of libertarian ideals.  Not something China is well known for."

Before I had any Bitcoin, I would think of anyone talking about that stuff as someone looking for the quickest place to lose their money.

I thought it was a place to buy hope for riches but at the same time you're sure it would never happen.

It looked like they were self sabotaging.

Then, which was in 2017, I was 18 and these guys (my friends) were busy buying BTC, ETH and all that.

I thought of them as soon to be millionaires whenever they mentioned Bitcoin because I never understood what it really meant and whatever.

But then the real jackpot happened..

The CEO of one website named mentor course review, taught me a cute little about BTC and sent me $150 worth of the coin.

This was around the period when BTC was moving from 30k to 40k. (December 2020)

I left the coin in my wallet and every new day I logged in I was around $20 richer.

LoL

It felt almost like striking gold in California.

So that was it, I became a preacher of Bitcoin.

Why not?

It was as if anyone leaving their money in the bank was a stupid uninformed citizen, 🙄.

""I think it became pretty clear that we, the Bitcoiners, have a good story, but it's a very complicated story. And we need to find a way to share our story and to educate [...] My first thought was there is no point in us tweeting back and forth at each other because I don't think a 288-character twitters are right ways to educate the public and build consensus. 

""So I reached out to Elon and I spoke with him and we had a very long conversation and [...] I asked him if he had relationship or had met with Bitcoin miners [...] Elon [...] said we would all benefit if we were able to publish energy usage and sources of energy usage data. It turns out that Bitcoin miners don't actually have a good form for communicating how they generate their energy. We don't have a shared common model for energy usage right now. [...] 

""I asked Elon if he had relationships with the miners and he said he'd like to meet them, so I reached out to the miners and I asked them if they'd like to meet Elon Musk, and they said yes, they would. And so we set up a meeting because he wanted to understand how they are mining and what their plans and futures are, and they wanted to understand his concerns, and we wanted to understand how we could be the good guys inthe entire ESG debate [...]

""And so I think that the group came together to get Elon's thoughts and for us to brainstorm on what we can do in order to communicate constructively to the entire industry and avoiding reinventing the wheel, right?"""

As it stands, many put options writers stand to lose a lot.  So to reduce the loss, I would expect a run-up of BTC price... But if you do that too much, right after the expiry, the price would go down pretty quickly, so essentially no gain.

I got my dad turned onto Bitcoin and he ended up with a sizeable chunk on coinbase, right? He gets his passwords compromised at least once a year, so being the dutiful son that I am, I buy him a trezor and my wife and I help him set it up. 

He's a little upset that he can't check his balance all the time, but I assure him it's much safer in his trezor that's sitting in his closet safe than it is on coinbase.  

Fast forward to yesterday. I'm on vacation and he calls me asking why his trezor pin doesn't work. He tells me, ""it already had me put in all 24 of those damn passwords, why won't it work?"". 

I told him over and over and over when I set up his trezor and the seed phrase. ""Dad, don't type this in anywhere, don't even take a photo of it"". And what does he do the first time he tries to use his trezor himself?

I am so angry and frustrated right now it's kinda ruining my vacation. You cannot save people from themselves."

1622155685,Bitcoin,"Addressing My Retiring Father's Crypto Concerns I'm having a discussion with my father(62) who is approaching retirement age about using crypto as a way to diversify his investments. He will have a comfortable retirement regardless of adopting cryptocurrency; but I'd like to turn him around on his stance. He understands the store of wealth concept; but doesn't think crypto works as a currency. His takes:

1. Takes notice of high transaction fees compared to standard credit
2. And experiences FUD regarding the federal government not adopting/outright banning crypto. Obviously no entity can ""take down"" crypto; but I kind of see his point that sanctions from the US government would limit its practical applications and/or value.

Background: He is a tech guy, and has always been a proponent of innovation and moving things forward while also being a highly skeptical person who hails from a small-farm in a very rural area. He helped introduce GPS precision mapping to farming in the 90's. Builds his own planes, invested in the internet pre and post bubble. Forward-thinking guy all around; but gives no time to bullshit or pipedreams. Not a dreamer if you will, very much a pragmatic realist.

What can I tell him regarding those two points? I really would like to win him over with some honest talking points. And honestly, I'm interested in learning more about those issues myself."

1622153105,Bitcoin,"How to hold on to a large amount of Bitcoin without getting robbed, hacked, or kidnapped?Many years ago I acquired a larger amount of Bitcoins.. it was an almost trivial investment and I told so many people about it. Back then there were rumors about limited entropy on Intel CPUs so I generated my wallet/private key using a physical dice. I wrote down the private key on a physical paper and I even showed this around as a party gag sometimes. Many people knew that I had coins and that I store them in a cold wallet at home.

This creates a problem for me now. Bitcoin considerably grew in value, and this is now a massive investment. I now sometimes fear for my safety.. People in the news are getting harmed for much smaller amounts than this.

I had the idea to just store it at deposit box with a bank. But how can I trust them to keep a private key... I obviously can't. What is the best way out of this dilemma?

Also, would you recommend that I split it into many smaller wallets?

Lastly, I only have the private key and corresponding public key. I assume that this is sufficient to access the coins (sweat), I guess there must be some Wallet softwares that I can just load the private key into, right? Are there any pitfalls to be aware of, for example I heard about return addresses and that Bitcoins can get lost if I send only a part of it. Thank you!"

1622150651,Bitcoin,"Medallion signatures and DEFI -- the irony.Quick story on why DEFI is going to swallow the traditional financial institutions. 

I have been doing periodic wire transfers from Fidelity to Kraken and Kraken requires a unique code that you have to include with your wire so they know where to debit the funds to when they arrive. Well, in the online wire forum on Fidelity, there isn't a field to input this info so I have to call and manually read over all the wire instructions. It's a fucking pain in the asshole. 

I can create standing wire instructions if I fill out a form and send it into fidelity via the mail. Ok, a bit ridiculous but I'll do it once and be done. One aspect of this form is that you need a medallion signature from a bank. Well, I go down to BofA to get a medallion and they tell me that I need to A) make a special appointment B) bring an account  statement for my Fidelity account AND the Kraken account and C) then they will review for around a week and MIGHT be able to issue a Medallion after that point. 

The whole situation is literally just beyond retarded to the point of comedy. 

Want to wire money to Kraken? Oh sorry, BofA charges $25 bucks an outbound wire. Ok fine I'll use Fidelity as an intermediary. Well fuck now Fidelity is a PITA and doesn't even allow me to enter the wire online so I have to call them EVERY time (I actually really like Fidelity). Ok, no problem -- I'll create standing wire instructions. JK jumping through those hoops are more of a pain than just calling for each wire. 

The fact that I'm trying to deal with all this to buy somewhat obscure (mostly) DeFi digital assets is so beautifully ironic to me. These poor suckers don't know whats about to hit them but the next 10 years are going to be insanely transformative. Just remember that you are still very very early."

As someone who has no crypto at all, why should i invest in Bitcoin?

I understand what it is, the future of blockchain, the inevitable trend to digital currencies, etc.

But how do you just overlook the volatility and actually put money into it?

It goes up 1,000% in a year. Then tanks 50% in 6 weeks, partially due to some tweets from a billionaire and one country cracking down. The last few months have proven that it is certainty not a viable inflation hedge. Not at this stage anyway.

Nothing has changed since April in terms of the limited number of coins available, the future prospects, the theories about it being digital gold. But it still tanked 50%.

I know, volatility is all part of what you have to accept with crypto. I get that.

But - why are you investing in in? Do most of you see this as a bit of a gamble with some side money? Or do you genuinely have it as your main investment for the future?

Getting in early would have been amazing. But why would i get in now?

(To repeat; this is a genuine question.)"

1622239458,Bitcoin,"Why the energy FUD actually isn't FUDThe price recovered since the dip and the question of the energy consumption of bitcoin has been conviniently brushed aside as FUD. But is it really ?

The very core of bitcoin is to waste as much ressources as possible, so nobody can physically rewrite its database : smart in a world without alternatives, but it well could ultimately cause its demise.

First when I discovered bitcoin, I really found that POW was a brilliant solution to secure the network. Up until today, it has made of bitcoin the most secure blockchain in the world. I am definitively sold on the fact that blockchain is beneficial in many aspects for mankind, and that in itself, could justify spending the amount of energy of an average sized developped country to maintain it. But now, new consensus emerge with an increased maturity (variations around POS) and big ecosystems built upon them are on the verge of true global adoption (real world applications, not just defi and stuff). When one of those ecosystems will enter in our daily lives, the amount of usage and the spread of the associated tokens will give it a level of decentralization and immutability that will eventually even surpass bitcoin's. So in a world where you have the security of bitcoin with orders of magnitude less energy consuption, how could bitcoin's POW keep being relevant or acceptable ?

I keep hearing a few very weak arguments to counter this ""FUD"" from people who are heavily invested in bitcoin, but nothing really convincing :

\- bitcoin consumes less energy than gold mining/the banking sector/etc. First, bitcoin has almost no real world usage, so to compare it with what really powers the world today to make it look good in comparison is a joke (without a functioning bank system, you wouldn't have been able to buy bitcoin in the first place). And second, this deflection totally misses the point that new blockchains are coming to the world and will provide all the benefits of bitcoin (and more) without consuming close as much energy.

\- bitcoin will use ""renewable energy"", so where's the biggy ? First, the reality of bitcoin mining electricity, is that it reflects quite well how electricity is made in the world : around 70% coal, and that's not going to change overnight. Curbing our GHG emissions is a matter of survival for mankind, so blowind inconsiderate and avoidable amounts of carbon in the atmosfere is just criminal. Second, what is marketed as ""renewable energy"" in the media, wind power and especially solar panels, are not renewable energies at all. When you watch a solar panel, it looks design, futuristic, so clean... but it's just ignoring the shameful energy consumption that went into mining the rare elements that are needed to build it and the apaling environmental destructions that all that causes.

Mankind is entering a phase where we have touched, even passed the limits of sustainability of our planet. Energy is a scarce ressource that is becoming scarcer every day (especially assuming you don't want to boil the planet down with fossil fuel emissions). It's criminal to keep pumping energy in something that has technologically been far improved by more modern and refined solutions. One day, and I don't give it more than a couple of years, this will be just too obvious to be denied."

I wanted to confirm the process to appropriately testing the recovery of a wallet (and funds within the wallet). Currently, I am running:

- Coldcard
- Wasabi Wallet

In order to test the recovery, I would imagine I could:

1. Transfer funds to Coldcard (e.g 0.01 BTC)
2. Wipe the Coldcard 
3. Delete the Coldcard wallet config from Wasabi
4. Reboot coldcard and input recovery seed phrase
5. Load Coldcard config to Wasabi wallet
6. Check balance of Coldcard in wasabi to confirm funds recovered (from step #1)
7. Send a transaction from Wasabi, signed by recovered Coldcard, to confirm full control over recovered Coldcard

However, in April I had been looking to buy a Vespa scooter to get around and to also fill a void as a project when lo and behold one popped up on ebay and after some discussion with the owner we struck a deal where I would get 2 Vespas for £600 and the beauty of the deal was that I could also pay in Bitcoin. This saved me from paying any fees to the exchanges and this was also the first time that I had used Bitcoin to pay for anything. In all I paid £606 in Bitcoin easily and quickly on the day and I am now the proud owner of a freshly MOT'ed scooter on the road and one which I am in the process of breaking down and rebuilding.

OFC Fomo hit me hard after that and I bought like half a coin. I traded A LOT until May and thought I could work my way up there to owning a full coin, that was the goal. However, I also knew that I would have to pay taxes some day. I bought in one day before the ""crash"" and elons tweets, so I was down bad. 

So, I told myself that this could be a chance, a sign from god. If I sold with a HUGE loss, i would realize my losses and break even with my winnings, so I would not have to worry about taxes. I would be at my starting point but maybe I could be able to afford the whole coin. So I did exactly that. 

I joined the 21 Million Club baby and moved that shit directly to my ledger. Lesson definetely learned, I wont touch that shit. No trading anymore. No money or bitcoins on any wallet anymore, its all stored in a safe place for when I need the money.

1622327346,Bitcoin,"We do the work, they take the profits: some cynically good news for BTC**The tl;dr here is that I believe BTC is going to go up sooner or later because it will benefit the already-wealthy and their institutions.**

Now, here's the **LONG VERSION:**

Capitalism is a system of wealth accumulation which allows people with a lot of money to put that money to work so that they can generate more money. It's hard for most workaday schlubs to understand this because our experience with money is totally different.

We sell our labor as a commodity to get money so we can buy food and shelter and other commodities we need to live. There's rarely enough money left over for more than a few little luxuries, but if you're very strategic, willing to sacrifice short term pleasure for long-term rewards, and also very lucky, you MIGHT be able to make some of your money work for you and scrape together an early retirement or even buy your way into the capitalist class by starting a business of your own.

Assuming your business doesn't fail, like most small business startups, then eventually you will find yourself having a different relationship with money and commodities:

Rather than selling your labor as a commodity, you will invest your surplus wealth (your CAPITAL) into commodities (which might include the commoditized labor of other working schlubs) so that you can generate EVEN MORE MONEY for yourself. At this point, you are a CAPITALIST, and your money -- your CAPITAL -- is doing the majority of the work for you.

This is what is meant when people say CEOs are in the business of ""allocating capital."" The real job of a REAL capitalist (someone who is a real mover, not just some poor small business owner working 60 hours a week running a small business with modest profits to pay his mortgage but a REAL ACTUAL CAPITALIST) is to put money to work and let others do the labor and take the real risks for him.

As an example, look at the way venture capital and tech startups typically operate. Investors pay for little tech companies to startup with the goal and ambition of being bought out by much larger companies. In this relationship, the smaller investors and startups take on a huge risk (again, most startups fail) with the hopes of a jackpot chance at getting bought for millions by Google/Apple/etc.

This arrangement is really great for the Googles and Apples of the world because they can just come in and buy out the company AFTER the majority of the risk has been taken and the basic infrastructure of the business has been built. At this level, capitalists aren't even making money by buying and selling commodities any more, they're actually making money by buying and selling entire companies.

The key takeaway here is that people, corporations, and institutions with an INCREDIBLE amount of money make their money not through labor but through throwing money around, making money work for them, at scales most people can never imagine. Even if you do pretty well, your life savings are probably a drop in the bucket for these folks.

And this brings us to Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not a company, nor a tech startup, nor a software product. It really is something totally new and unprecedented. For most of us who got in earlier, it was a dream of escaping state financial oppression and monetary mismanagement, a chance to put our savings into an asset that would resist inflation and grow our wealth, and an opportunity to decentralize wealth that would liberate normal working folks so that we could have more control of our own assets.

After all, BTC can be very easily hidden, it can't be seized by any government (assuming they can't get your keys), it can be used anonymously, and it levels the playing field so that everyone can buy in on equal footing since there's no central authority to pull the puppet strings.

And for years, this dream was more or less a reality, and to this day, BTC remains incredibly state-resistant. It's very difficult for states to govern BTC, and banning it would be as difficult as banning the internet. So, yeah, that's awesome.

And it didn't come easily. BTC had to be built out over many years by true believers. A lot of people invested a lot of time, tears, and labor power into making BTC what it is today. People with modest means took huge risks, held through ups and downs, added layers of tech like lightning network, hardwre wallets, exchanges, P2P networks, and so much more, so that BTC could become established like it is today as the king of crypto.

All along the way, there were detractors saying BTC would fail, and plenty of huge dips where it seemed like that would be exactly the case, but the people who built BTC kept chipping away at the problems, finding solutions, and HOLDING ON because they believed in the dream. Some people got very very wealthy because of these efforts, and even more people lost their shirts.

But by 2021, the hard work and risk-taking had paid off, and BTC sarted hitting big in the mainstream, making massive gains, getting attention and positive press.

Now, imagine you are a tech-savvy and already extremely wealthy CEO, fund manager, or capitalist who has been watching BTC all along. Someone with access to \*billions\* of dollars to invest. You understand and believe in BTC, but right now it's 2012, or 2017, or 2019, and BTC is cheap, yes, but there seem to be problems to work out and infrastructure that remains to be built.

Of course you COULD enter now, take a huge risk, and maybe that big risk will take off. And that's what some CEOs and millionaires did early on. But that's not the SAFE bet. That's not making your MONEY work for you -- that's making YOU work for you. You'll have to put in the time, and more importantly take the huge RISK with YOUR assets to make this all pay off.

OR... you could WAIT. Wait until you feel like BTC is just starting to really take off and come into its own and become a worthy, respected asset with a secure underfooting.

And THEN you can put your MONEY to work for you. After all, it only takes a few million bucks to significantly move the market, and you have BILLIONS. (It's hard for most people to imagine how much money a billion dollars is... see here: [https://imgur.com/gallery/HXUa1HW](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXUa1HW) )

So what would have been smarter, to take a big risk on a not-quite-proven-and-secured cryptocurrency when it was selling at \~$30k, or wait for it to really take off, then throw in a few paltry millions of dollars to tank the price down to \~$30k, then buy whatever you need for your plans before pumping it back up? While you're at it, you can get your rich friends who [own all the media companies](https://9gag.com/gag/aW6xL4n) to gin up FUD to drive the price even lower, and then when you're ready for the price to go back up you just do a little more manipulating of both the market and the media and get the price back up and beyond to that all time high.

Now, obviously, one person or entity would have a hard time doing this all alone. So along the way you've been meeting with and discussing and laying out these plans with your buddies-with-billions. So that by the time this all plays out, you've gotten just what you wanted without having to take any real risks yourself. You let tose suckers-with-dreams, the early innovators and expansionists of BTC, take all that risk for you. You've let them do all the labor of building out a platform that will generate trilions of dollars in the decades to come. And most importantly, you've let your MONEY work for you! You've just done what you've always done: you've been a capitalist!

Now, some people will say ""this sounds like a conspiracy theory.""

But which is more likely:

A scenario in which wealthy, powerful people are working together to further their own interests, or a scenario in which they are not? Do you really think it's that far-fetched that these wealthy billionaires and their financial managers are talking together and trying to game the system? Ultimately it's up to you to decide what you believe. Just look at the world around you, gather evidence and draw your own conclusions.

I COULD go through now and try to assemble a huge source list of all the evidence: of the weird coincidences of FUD dropping simultaneously in all the different news sources at just the right time, of blockchain evidence that more ""rich"" wallets are being gathered up, of strangely timed announcements and Tweets from financial managers and institutions who will be offering BTC-related services in the coming year... But a) I'm too lazy and this thread is already too long, and b) you've been living through it, if you've been involved in BTC for at least a year, and again, I invite you to look at what you've experienced and gather your own evidence and draw your own conclusions.

But, if what I'm saying IS true, then you can rest assured that BTC's price WILL go up, and by a LOT, as soon as these capitalists - or, ""whales"" as we call them around these parts - are good and ready for the price to go up. These people aren't making these moves for fun. They're putting their assets (fiat money, access to news rooms, and institutional power) to make MORE MONEY, and that will ultimately mean BTC bringing in GAINS.

For ""little guys,"" it's mostly a question of: how long can you hold? Which is another reason they'll always have a leg up over us. They have way more ammo than we do, they have a lot more lasting power. As Warren Buffett said, ""the stock market is a device that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient."" I have no reason to see why this device will function any differently.

I, for one, will never be surprised when capitalism functions  exactly as it always has. Instead, I will do my best to work within its perameters and follow the big money to try to make myself as secure as possible... especially since basic security seems like it will be an increasing luxury which fewer and fewer of us have access to in the years to come. But that's a topic for an overly long thread for another time!

Invest only what you're willing to lose, watch the whales, and stay safe out there, working schlubs!"

But to be fair I am becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the notion that proof of stake will be more likely adopted.  Even if a technology is superior if the vast majority don't believe in it it's still hold its value as a digital asset?

I hope it's not the FUD getting to me.  On the one hand I firmly and strongly believe in Bitcoin.  However my fear is it's valued me not be recognized until after the last coin is mined in which case I will probably not be on this planet anymore.

I could use some reassurance that even if proof of stake is what's adapted by the vast majority of the world's population that the superior technology of Bitcoin won't be flatlined. As in it stops to continue to grow and just stays where it's at.

This is all probably noobie fears. And I am in it for the long term. But I just wonder about psychology of the vast majority population."

1622419805,Bitcoin,"This Bullrun may last until June 03, 2022!The reality is, coming up with June 03, 2022 is done by a simple mathematical formula. I simply computed the number of days from the previous halving dates to their respective ATH. For 2013, it is 367. For 2017, it is 526 days.

Then I divided 526 by 367, to get this ""golden"" ratio of 1.433242507

Multiplying the golden ratio to 526 will result in 753.9. Add that to May 11, 2020, halving date, and we will get June 03, 2022. The simple conclusion is, the ATH for this bull run will come near that date. 

Currently, 31/5/2021, is the 385th day of this bull run. Using the golden ratio, and it will be translated to as the April 3, 2017 of the previous run.   


What is interesting is, during this period, we also can see a fractal resembling a Wyckoff Distribution model. It is not perfect, but the resemblance is there.

&amp;#x200B;

[Now, being on April 3, means the bottom should already be in. So, the moment that the $30K is broken, the idea of this post could be invalidated. ](https://preview.redd.it/lkmo6co3kc271.png?width=1025&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85113d7c74d4d6513134cd9802d71c04e6728f14)

Now, using the golden ratio, here are the important dates to follow:  


Around July 09, 2021 - Breaking of the current ATH

Around Sept. 07, 2021 - A new higher high ATH will be created

Fundamentally, I think, it is safe to assume that we will have a much longer bull run than 2017. This is because of the presence of more money and of more big players who can control the price and the narrative.

Coinbase backed project with mainnet already launched.Hey guys, just wanted to let you know about innovative crypto project that I have stumbled upon. I really see the potential for this proof of stake crypto to become a top 20 market-cap coin in the following months. Let me explain why.

The entire Mina blockchain is and will always be 22kb - the size of a couple of tweets. So anyone with a smartphone will be able to sync and verify the network in seconds. It is based on zk-Snark technology that even the Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin have recognised as a game changer in blockchain industry. [https://www.coindesk.com/500-transactions-a-second-vitalik-says-zk-snarks-could-scale-ethereum](https://www.coindesk.com/500-transactions-a-second-vitalik-says-zk-snarks-could-scale-ethereum)

Through its SNARK-powered applications called Snapps, they aims to bring new possibilities for internet privacy and data security. And they have already launched mainnet. [https://www.coindesk.com/mina-mainnet-launch-token-sale](https://www.coindesk.com/mina-mainnet-launch-token-sale)

They have many well known investors and one of them is Coinbase ventures and that could mean that in the near future it could be launched on Coinbase as have happened with other Coinbase backed coins like Polygon; Graph protocol and Celo. You can scroll down the list and find Mina in the investment section in this link. [https://ventures.coinbase.com/](https://ventures.coinbase.com/)

And when you look in the investor section for Mina protocol, you can even see Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder and Board Member of Coinbase. [https://minaprotocol.com/about](https://minaprotocol.com/about)

Another interesting point to mention is that the Mina Foundation and Ethereum Foundation have already announced a joint request for proposals (RFP), to enable recursive SNARK applications, on the Ethereum blockchain. [https://minaprotocol.com/announcements/mina-foundation-and-ethereum-foundation-launch-joint-rfp](https://minaprotocol.com/announcements/mina-foundation-and-ethereum-foundation-launch-joint-rfp)

It’s up to you to invest in this project, however, considering the possibilities that this crypto project can achieve, I have good hopes for this coin to succeed."

It seems that transaction fees for most stable coins (USDT, USDC for example) are extreme, so there doesn't seem to be an advantage there.

Let's say I deposit 1BTC in the my wallet address given by the exchange and then use that to buy-sell-trade several ALT coins. Normally to buy or sell a crypto coin/token we need to pay the transaction fee because we are using the blockchain and someone is verifying the transaction (Like when we actually send X crypto from one exchange to another). But what happens when we are just trading in the exchange; when we are buying and selling cryptos? Are we just interacting with the exchange's database where they just put up a number according to the order execution or do they have their own private blockchain where the transaction happens in realtime or what actually happens?

1622402285,Bitcoin,"Quantum computers and the security of the Bitcoin blockchainSo, recently i found [this](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/artikelen/quantum-computers-and-the-bitcoin-blockchain.html) article from Deloitte where you can read:

""Quantum computers are posing a serious challenge to the security of the Bitcoin blockchain. Presently, about 25% of the Bitcoins in circulation are vulnerable to a quantum attack. If you have Bitcoins in a vulnerable address and believe that progress in quantum computing is more advanced than publicly known, then you should probably transfer your coins to a new p2pkh address (...)

**Even if everyone takes the same protection measures, quantum computers might eventually become so fast that they will undermine the Bitcoin transaction process**. **In this case the security of the Bitcoin blockchain will be fundamentally broken**. The only solution in this case is to transition to a new type of cryptography called ‘post-quantum cryptography’, which is considered to be inherently resistant to quantum attacks. These types of algorithms present other challenges to the usability of blockchains and are being investigated by cryptographers around the world. We anticipate that future research into post-quantum cryptography will eventually bring the necessary change to build robust and future-proof blockchain applications.""

Since i'm new in the crypto area, i was not aware of this issue.

What is your opinion about this? And what does this mean to the Bitcoin blockchain (or any current blockchain i guess)? Can it be improved to a ‘post-quantum cryptography’ or will it just become useless?

Thanks in advance!"

Also like gold it can be used as a medium of exchange but not often because imo they are both a pain in the ass for that use.

1622501847,Bitcoin,"A company requesting fundsA company requesting funds might still ask for ether but to avoid being lumped in the ICO craze, not issue a token. Instead they might ask for email addresses to record contributions. There’s nothing wrong with this approach but it suffers from some disadvantages. Chief among forgone opportunities is that the decentralized management of stake in the company has been replaced with centralized management of an email database.

A token can act not only as a mechanism to use the technology but as a controlling share in the company. This allows the company to further decentralize top level decisions by allowing shareholders to vote in proportion of their holdings.

The voting takes place on the blockchain and is immune to pre-blockchain corruption. In this way, the issuance of a token is the very opposite of a get rich quick scam.

If in doubt about anything, do not interact with the suspected scam. Which magazine offers key advice which really summarizes the issue: “If you don’t understand a cryptocurrency or an investment, avoid it. Do not hand over any money.

The problem is that cryptocurrency has a strong reputation as an easy way to make money, and too many people are being lured in by that premise and overlooking the warning signs. Be aware of the risks and potential pitfalls, and use the tips above to help you make the right decision.

Every social media platform lets you report posts for suspicious links or spam. If you identify a scam in the wild, try to report it Bestresolute.com so as to minimize its effect on other users. If everyone does this, the whole community benefits."

In other words, after the price rises back up to the original price I bought at ($50,000 here), would I just be at $4750?

(for dummies)One of the popular concerns about [bitcoin](https://guarda.com/coins/bitcoin-wallet/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=bitcoin-beginners): it's too slow for everyday use especially in terms of transaction confirmation. Why is it so? In brief, the longer confirmation means that more people are interested in using bitcoin for transactions. That’s why BTC network traffic may produce delays.

In fact, transactions on the Bitcoin network itself are controlled by bitcoin miners. Confirmation might be slow because of bitcoin network traffic. It can be high due to the increasing demand for transactions per block. Block sizes are limited, so transactions that exceed the capacity for a block get stuck in a queue for confirmation by the miners.

A good example is the 2017 bull market when traders and investors were forced to wait days for their Bitcoin transactions to clear. Also, the higher demand for bitcoin means a higher transaction fee. However, we have found a solution for our clients.

1622494706,Bitcoin,"Taproot lock-inHi, I would like  to have some clarification about the taproot lock-in.

I pretty certain that I got this right. During a difficulty period miners will signal with the blocks and if the blocks amount to more than 90% then Taproot will be locked-in. But I've also understood that the miners have to continue signal 90% of the blocks for X amount difficulty periods. If it's even so how many difficulty periods is needed. 

And let say if it would be locked in in this difficulty period when would it be activated assuming +90% of blocks will signal it?

Thanks!"

But this got me thinking.

Online gaming is a bit problem. It's highly addictive and destructive and breaks up marriages and families. Addicts often can't pay their bills and mortgages and their children often go hungry as a result of this vice.

Yet I've never once received a warning from my bank alerting me to the dangers of it. I've also never had any payments to betting / gaming sites stopped or questioned by my bank. I place the odd bet from time to time.

So how come they are so concerned about me losing money investing in bitcoin when it's been the best performing asset of the last 10 years, outperforming every stock on the planet, whereas gambling almost always results in losing everything? What's their angle?"

1622488490,Bitcoin,Crypto Crash: 3 Things you need to Know
1622488476,Bitcoin,"Etherum is a shitcoin. It doesn't compare to Bitcoin in terms of a investment.History, Vatilk couldn't control and print Bitcoin, so he decided to make his own cryptocurrency that he could print. His first action was printing (pre-mine) 72,000,000 ETH coins and giving them to himself and his buddies. He then sold a bunch of these for bitcoin, becuase the only point of touching altcoins, is to get more bitcoin.   


About two weeks ago at the highs vatilk sold nearly a billion dollars worth of etherum and $0 bitcoin. He owns both but always chooses to sell etherum. Eventually he will run out of ETH and unable to print more he will ditch the project and move on to a new coin that he can print a premine for himself. He's buddy Charles has already done this and thats what gave birth to cardono. Altcoiners are never loyal and you will be left holding the bag.

&amp;#x200B;

Compare to Bitcoin. The creator satoshi, never made a cent off of bitcoin. He never sold a single bitcoin. And he left the project and the project continues to grow. He didn't start a new project after bitcoin. He wasn't in it for the money. Meanwhile, 100% of altcoin creators are just trying to make some money at the expense of anyone dumb enough to buy their pump and dump coin. You only need bitcoin for investing."

1622594826,Bitcoin,"Coworker bought $100 of btc ""when it first came out""First time making a real post, so bear with me a little.

I worked with a guy a few years back who came up to me and asked if I had any investing experience. I said I had made about $900 buying and selling Bitcoin. He says, ""Bitcoin...oh yeah I bought $100 worth of that stuff when it first came out.""  My jaw hit the table. I then did some calculations and told him what he could be potentially sitting on. At that moment Bitcoin had just hit $10,000. I told him he needs to find it asap.  He said he would look around the next upcoming holiday when he drives to his relatives house. Apparently it was on their old computer.  My day, week, and month was shot. This was all I could think of. I watched videos about recovering wallets. I downloaded Bitcoin core, electrum and bought more Bitcoin. At the time I had none of my own and hadn't played around with wallets much, just bought/sold on coinbase. We eventually were talking about me helping to recover it and he offered me $1,000,000 for my help.  I told him I was thinking more like 5% and he agreed to that. I wanted some sort of proof like an email receipt. He says it was in an old Gmail account that he no longer has access too since he doesn't have the same cellphone number that is attached to it. The cellphone number is now in use so it's not accessible.  He doesn't remember how he bought it either.  At this point I'm getting a little peeved. This guy is not helping much while potentially holding millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.  I understand that it's his but I'm a little invested at this point. We eventually found out that his relative sold the computer a number of years back at a rummage sale.  I still had so many unanswered questions. Did they back it up, did they keep the hardrive, did they wipe it, etc. At this point he is no longer helping and wouldn't let me talk directly to his relative.  I believe he is in denial that it ever happened so he doesn't have to live with the thought of losing it.  We work in different trades now so I don't talk to him much, just the occasional Facebook banter.
I still think about it, I mean who wouldn't. Definitely feel like we didn't try hard enough.

Tldr; 
Coworker bought $100 worth of btc ""when it first came out"". The computer it was on was sold at a rummage sale years later."

For example, if you used FIFO in 2020 to report your crypto taxes, you can switch and use LIFO in 2021.  This assumes that the LIFO calculation is based on the FIFO results of the prior year FIFO.

1622582742,Bitcoin,"BTC is forever changed. Stop whining and take advantage of it.**TL;DR:** The BTC market has undergone a fundamental change and we are never going back to the world of a year ago. This was bound to happen. But the fundamentals of the technology haven't changed, and Whale Dominance of the market is NOT the same thing as centralization. So get used to it, and adapt to the new environment!

Okay, now the long version:

A lot of us got involved with Bitcoin for philosophical reasons. Most of us who have been around for more than a year, I'd say, got involved with BTC because of what it offers in terms of freedom from the state, freedom from centralization, privacy, opposition to fractional reserve banking and inflation, etc.

You can all these old-timers the ""Philosophical Bitcoiners.""

And you can count me in that group. I got into BTC because I got sick of the government and big corporate interests screwing me over every few years with recessions, bailouts, tax laws that benefit the wealthy over the working man, etc.

But I always knew the ""whales"" would come, that eventually our own success would draw the wealthy over to BTC and they would begin manipulating and dominating the markets. In [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/) I explained how and why whales let us, the Philosophical Bitcoiners, take all the risk and do all the investing in building out this platform. Now that the whales have entered, we have to understand the shift in circumstances.

I see a lot of people whining about the current state of affairs, complaining that people don't invest in BTC for the right reasons any more, that folks are just buying BTC to try to get rich.

And yeah, thay annoys me as well. I WANT people to understand BTC, understand what makes it fundamentally different from any previous financial instrument in history. But the whales, specifically, don't care about ANY of that.

They fetishize BTC in the way they fetishize all commodities. That is to say:

When whales invest in Ford, they don't give a shit about the cars. They just want the stock to go up so they can make more money.

When whales invest in gold, they don't give a shit about the shiny rocks. They just want the price of gold to go up so they can make more money.

When whales by a company, they don't care about the workers or the customers. They just want the profits to go up so they can make more money.

This is a fundamental aspect of any market that allows people who have accumulated billions of dollars to enter -- because this is the only way to accumulate billions of dollars!

Look at the assets that are being disclosed belonging to Bill Gates. The man owns more farmland than anyone else in the USA. You think he knows anything about farming? You think he cares about farming? He owns a private jet company. You think he bought it because he's passionate about aviation? You think he runs his ""foundation"" because he actually gives a shit? No, they're all wealth accumulation vehicles which fetishize the commodities, activities, and philosophical underpinnings of whatever sectors Billy boy has entered.

Such it is with BTC. These financial institutions like Black Rock and Goldman Sachs and whatever other billionaires and corporations are getting involved don't give a shit about the philosophy and promise of BTC, they are entering the market because they want to make more money. This should come as a surprise to nobody, and everybody should see that things will never go back to the way they were, because the billionaires can throw their money around and manipulate the media to their own advantage, and there's nothing we can do to stop them.

That said, I'd like to push back against a few narratives I frequently see around here:

1. Whales manipulating and dominating the market is **NOT the same thing as centralization**. Centralization would mean that these entities can actually control the RULES of BTC. In order to do that they'd need to control 51% of the nodes and 51% of the hash rate, and the chances of that happening are extraordinarily slim, even for billionaires, because of the brilliance of BTC's design.
2. BTC is not ""dead"" because of manipulation by whales. In fact, right this very moment is probably one of the last times in history you'll be able to enter BTC with a good chance of benefitting the most as a smaller investor. You can ""ride the whales"" up, knowing that they're going to want a return on their investment.
3. The whales aren't trying to ""kill"" BTC because they're ""afraid"" of it. They see it as an opportunity to make more money, and they WILL make more money with BTC. The smart banks will get in and turn it to their advantage and sucker people into ""buying"" BTC with their proprietary virtual wallets, BTC-""backed"" derivatives and financial systems will start to crop up, and all kinds of shell games will be played to con normal average people who don't understand the philosophy of BTC into thinking they own BTC when they don't. This will drive the price of BTC up without really benefitting the ""suckers."" We're already seeing the embryonic form of this kind of shit with things like ""Binance Chain"" and Robinhood's BTC ""investment,"" etc.

The fact is, if you understand BTC, you will be able to take advantage of all the same benefits we always have. You will be able to really and truly own it, as long as you alone have the keys. The government can't seize it from you if you can keep your keys secret. It will always be anti-inflationary. It will always be decentralized. Nothing about the fundamentals has changed.

The only thing that has changed is that the price can be manipulated by whales (who will generally prefer to see the price go up over the long term) and a lot more people will be using it who don't understand it (which is just the nature of literally any currency or asset... most people who use fiat money don't understand fiat money, but that doesn't stop them from using it).

So, does it kinda suck that whales have entered BTC? Does this fundamentally change the BTC environment? Yes. But this is the cost of growth within the capitalist system. As long as individuals and corporations are able to accumulate billions of dollars this is always going to be the case. But BTC can't be fundamentally corrupted and sabotaged from within like the stock market and fiat money, which is a distinction we should all be aiming to leverage.

As always, don't invest more than you can afford to lose, and best of luck."

But some cash register clerk told me to *invest* into Bitcoin. I thought to myself, hmm an ordinary person told me to.... *Invest*......

So what did I do? I opened up a Robinhood account and transferred my life savings into it. Purchased 4.20 BTC’s and it couldn’t have been a better quantity.

🔺Introduction

Velorex (VEX) is a decentralized finance token built on the BEP-20 platform. At Velorex we aim to facilitate global adoption of our cryptocurrency by introducing Debit cards and Smart Wallets that dynamically interact with a variety of Web3.0 and related programs within our block-chain from 2022 onward.

Currently, our primary focus is geared towards the implementation of the VEX token into a real world application in the form of essential innovative decentralized services. This will be realized by the 'VEXchange' which is being developed concurrently and will enable our users to experience low cost, high speed purchasing of products &amp; procurement of services through the global online marketplace while providing a decentralized payment gateway, transfer protocol and asset storage capability for VEX token.

🔸 Some basic info:

🔸Name: VELOREX

🔸Symbol: VEX

🔸Decimals: 9

🔸Max supply: 500.000.000

🔸Market Cap: 7M+$

🔸Target price for upcoming months : 0.5$/VEX

🔸Target price for EOY: 1.00$

🔸5$ IS EASILY ACHIVABLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE BLOCKCHAIN COMING UP, AND SO MUCH USE CASES FOR VELOREX.

On top of that, by allowing the project to mature and grow in value during the locking period, we will ensure significant progress can be made on the utility of the project as well. We are still hard at work on the development of the Velorex debit cards and ATMs, rest assured.

Our Technology Makes It Work

1622681811,Bitcoin,"Relax friends, everything's going to be alright!I know this is going to piss some people off but I just wanted to share my thoughts on soemthing that bugs me about the crypto community.

The trope (thats really not so much of a trope) is that people expect every fucking investment they make to 10x this year or it wont have been a success or its somehow a disappointment. 

In the grand scheme of things, if you did have to wait 4-5 years before things really mooned that would really be an insane return. If the average stock market return is around 10% then whats really to complain about? 

**When in doubt, zoom out!**

I know this post is pretty all over the place I just wanted to share my thoughts that yes its possible that we may not moon this month or next but we will eventually and if you hodl and dca in you will be rich! It's just really sad to watch some traders enter crypto, be down about 20% and then deciding it's not for them. I mean look, I get it; crypto's not for everyone but I think a lot of people get in as a get rich quick kind of thing and then cut bait the moment something seems like it wont pan out.

Because Im American I'm going to throw out a stat I heard, not sure how it applies to your country. Apparently, something like 50% of American's arent invested in anything!! Thats right NOTHING at all. Can you believe that? For many reasons I would assumed most obviously because of lack of funds? In my opinion its because of lack of knowledge. They probably just dont know or distrust the system or maybe lost a little money and decided investing wasnt for them

How does this relate to crypto?

I feel like the same thing is happening. I'm seeing the panic amongst many newbie crypto holders and I guess i'm just writing this because I want you guys to know that things will get better; they always do! We will moon eventually and you will attain that life changing wealth. You may just have to change your mindset. I've been investing in stocks for over 10 years and crypto on and off since 2017. I still don't think I know shit. Keep learning.

You really gotta understand the projects you invest in because if you dont, **FUD** will consume you! The people that understand what theyre invested in will buy up dips and the people who dont will always panic sell. thats just how the market works. Warren Buffet said "" The stock market is a device for **transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""** 

Also want to make one thing clear; I'm all for taking profit! Even though I diamond hand. I usually DCA out of my cost basis' up to 50-100% and then use that to re invest on dips. However, with crypto I've been holding a lot just because i invest consistently with my income.

Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk. I wish you all success"

Few years ago I was studying the worldwide financial system then during my researches I remember learning about Bitcoin for the first time in a youtube video speaking of a man named Satoshi Nakamoto.

Satoshi Nakamoto the creator of the Blockchain for me is among the most innovative individuals which ever appeared in the last centuries, making me wonder if this man that no one has ever seen is really from this world ? 

The gift that he brought to humanity is a radical civilization changing technology...
The Blockchain is a change in our way of living and most importantly in our way of thinking. 

I am because you are... This is the meaning of a word that many developers among you are familiar with, Ubuntu.
I am because you are... This is the philosophy that Satoshi Nakamoto is vehiculating all around the planet further and further every year.

For this reason me Quang Luc VO I have decided to give my full support in the best of my authority in order to insure that this philosophy keep on spreading everywhere.

Through my voice an infinity of opportunities for growth are coming to the Blockchain ecosystem. 
I would like to thank reddit.com for welcoming me within your community.

1622675886,Bitcoin,"Devaluation of the Lira and possible hyperinflation in TurkeySo, i'm not usually a great critic of inflation and arguments from hurr durr conomics as in ""the fiat system is taking away my freedums"", but there is one particular event as of right now that, similar to Venezuela, could let people turn to Bitcoin and crypto out of necessity, for the lack of an actual functioning national currency.

That event is the refusal of Erdogan and his followers that he set up the turkish central bank with. Erdogan refused to lower the interest rates of the central bank as it would crowd out businesses that rely on the infusion of more money into the market.

That is done in an effort force economic activity and the jobs that come with it.

But with the prior lowering of production output in major western economies like turkey in the pandemic, the devaluation of the turkish Lira that comes with this this step will not lead to a lower exchange price for turkish goods and services, as those will need to be produced first.

Instead, turkish production companies holding Lira will simply not have the purchasing power to buy their raw materials on the international market to even get production going. This will be particularly problematic with natural ressources often doubling and tripling in price, now that producers are buying out markets to get started again with the lift of lockdowns in western economies.

This means that not just will the turkish Lira be devaluated in relation to it's market capitalisation, but the general output of the turkish economiy will stay low and most likely even lower in comparisson to pre-pandemic levels.

More currency in circulation, less stuff to buy in that currency. Both sides of the inflation equasion are affected. This is screaming hyperinflation.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/turkish-lira-weakens-past-8-77-to-fresh-record-versus-dollar)

Now, before the ban in Turkey, Bitcoin had a relatively strong distribution in turkey. It had a lot of miners and speculants looking for a quick buck. It could very well turn out that the turkish will, out of sheer nessecity will have to turn to alternative currencies and with that they will turn to Bitcoin and other crypto.

Now, i thought about trying to justify making money from the suffering of the Turkish people by speculating in Bitcoin, but i really do not feel compelled to say sorry. I simply don't like muslims, so i'm fine with them having to buy the coins that i mined for a price that will probably ruin them because they don't have a choice.

What i only wanted to say with that, really:

Prepare for another moonshot. A mejor industrialised nation is going into hyperinflation and billions of dollars worth of purchasing power of the turkish people could flow into crypto."

I've been reading this: [https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address\_reuse](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Address_reuse) to try and understand how I can use bitcoin donations / bitcoin payments through a website.  


e.g. this incredibly helpful website: [https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,3m,weight](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,3m,weight) the author has a donation address at the bottom which is hardcoded.  


From the address reuse article, it says that bitcoin addresses are more like 'invoices', so it makes sense why you want a new invoice for each transaction.

I'm confused why reusing the same address/invoice ID is less secure and can expose details of your wallet/finances. Surely even a single transaction can expose your wallet, and from there, someone could view your balance and previous transactions?"

So if bitcoin ever has true economic value and use what do you think 0.5 BTC would be worth? I'm thinking if it does occur owning 0.5 would put you in the top 1% wealth wise. The trick is getting out before it hits $0 (if that ever happens). It’s going to be the best or worst financial gamble of your life regardless of which side you choose.

1622657057,Bitcoin,"Why 51% attacks only works on miners and not on nodes?I know that one of the possible dangers of is a 51% to the network. I always read that this 51% is about the hashing power of miners. But I have this question, why a 51% node attack is never mentioned? Because it doesn't work?"
1622656943,Bitcoin,"Thoughts on Bitcoin's energy usage and common explanationsThere's one specific aspect of how bitcoin mining is commonly explained that I wanted to share my thoughts on. The ""solving complex puzzles"" explanation of bitcoin mining. I'm not sure where the explanation originated from, but I've been watching it take hold over the years and it's never felt quite right to me. I hope this doesn't come across as a personal attack or anything, I'd like to address what I see as the shortcomings and then how I see things.

First off, I'm assuming that ""solving complex puzzles"" refers specifically to brute force hashing until you hit less than a magic number. I assume the ""complex"" part refers to using the SHA256 algorithm.

I find this analogous to rolling a d20 until you hit a 20. I don't think that can be considered a puzzle... you just roll until it happens. It's all brute force. Even if you're using a really ""complex"" die (SHA256).

I'm also not sure if this explanation provides more understanding of how bitcoin mining works, so much as sweeps it under the rug. ""Solving complex puzzles"" somewhat sounds like ""I can't explain, and you don't need to understand"" to me. I think it also leaves the impression that we're taking ""puzzle solving"" power away from things like medicine, or something else you might find useful. It sounds wasteful in general.

It also doesn't lend itself to understanding bitcoin's security properties if you want to dig in. If you're learning about bitcoin and see ""solving complex puzzles"", I'm not sure what understanding you can build on top of that.

Again, I hope my thoughts above don't come across as antagonistic. I haven't really put how I see things out there, so my own explanation may suck.

Here's how I would explain the part of bitcoin mining that ""solving complex puzzles"" refers to. Bitcoin mining works by attaching energy to your transactions. Or alternatively: associating energy with your transactions. (I'm not sure which wording I like better)

Why do I think of it as attaching energy to your transactions? Bitcoin's proof-of-work system creates the proof of energy spent, but that's not just being done on random data. That's being done specifically on the data (transactions) making up each new block. When a new block is found you now have a proof of the energy being spent by miners, and that proof is specifically associated with the transactions in the new block (and every transaction in every block before it).

I think this is a more tangible way to understand things, and then it's easier to build an explanation on top of that of where bitcoin's security comes from. And ultimately, that what's bitcoin's energy usage is going towards at the end of day: security. If you want to dig down and find out about details like SHA256 and target difficulties, I think it helps to understand that that is building up to ""attaching energy to your transactions"".

I won't go into how the attachment of energy then leads to bitcoin's higher level security properties, there's a million great explanations out there already. It all comes down to the energy, so I think ""attaching energy to your transactions"" slots nicely into all those explanations where ""solving complex puzzles"" currently is.

Also, some thoughts on bitcoin's current energy usage. Right now, the energy spent is somewhat forced by the mining subsidy. We're currently ""forced"" to pay 6.25BTC/block for security, in addition to whatever transactions fees are also paying for security. Whether that means we're currently spending too much or too little energy on security, I have no idea. And once the mining subsidy is no longer consequential, it'll be entirely in our hands how much we pay for security.

There are so many facets to a question like ""how much energy do we need to spend on bitcoin to keep it secure?"". I don't think we have the tools to answer this yet, or even the experience to know what questions to ask.

So why does bitcoin use energy? Well, I paid the miners to attach energy to my transaction in order to secure it, and so they did.

Thoughts? Do you find this a useful way to look at bitcoin mining? Hopefully I haven’t missed anything really obvious, but I wanted to put my way of looking at things out there."

– $34000 to $30,000; closing below $30k means that after all we are declining and in for a bear market

– $40,000 to $43000; served as major support. If we close above this level, chances are that we’re going for higher highs. That’s bye bye to $30k levels.

– $51,00 to $52000; this is one resistance that may try to stop us from updating a new ATH.

1622759603,Bitcoin,"Appreciation and PerspectiveJust finished reading “Digital Gold” by Nathaniel Popper. All I can say is, wow. 

I want to preface this post with: this book will not teach you how Bitcoin works. It is a history lesson. For the ‘what’ of Bitcoin, there are numerous amazing books that have been exhaustively discussed. This isn’t a post promoting or recommending any book in particular. 

Like so many, I dabbled in crypto with no clue what I was doing in 2017. My story isn’t unique or important so I’ll fast forward. The pandemic got me back in and now I, again like many, am full-blown obsessed. I’ve been reading books, posts, articles, and watching videos everyday for the better part of a year (still nowhere near an expert). Now that I have read Digital Gold, I have such a deeper appreciation for Bitcoin, where it came from,  and who it came from. I am also just floored beyond belief that this technology, ideology, and community has survived. Getting it off the ground, surviving horrific publicity and misinformation, bad actors, hacks, scams, crimes, and more FUD than I can begin to list...just wow. I finally feel more of an appreciation for all of the truisms that I can now recite from memory but never really thought about (not your keys not your coins, don’t leave coins on the exchange, never invest more than you’re willing to lose, etc.). In addition, the price action described in the book puts our current times into much greater context. My God, I can’t imagine being an OG and looking at a dip from 64k to 29k. When the current floor is an almost inconceivable ceiling from a very recent past, that’s what I call progress. 

If anyone reading this has been around since those early days, I want to sincerely thank you for believing in and sticking with this crazy idea and for putting up with the ridicule and accusations (ponzi schemers, pornographers, money launderers, drug dealers, terrorists, etc.). You are truly an integral part of this massive and beautiful system. I hope everyone out there appreciates what we are witnessing in real time and knows just how unbelievable this all is. As for me, I am proud and happy to be playing my infinitesimally small role of being a hodler, believer, and (to the increasing annoyance of those in my circle) an evangelist. 

Hodl on my friends."
1622759573,Bitcoin,"I made 10 million dollars trading crypto on my father's identity, and I'm not sure who should file taxes on it.So, some background:

The exchanges I wanted to trade on prohibited Americans, so my father gave me his foreign passport to open up some exchange accounts, and deposited about $20,000 in his name.  It is important to note he is a dual citizen who also files US taxes abroad.

I did this with his consent, but we never imagined that initial deposit would appreciate to that level, and I honestly got lucky riding this bull cycle in crypto.

My father is extremely old, knows absolutely nothing about crypto, and has never done any trading.  He just did me a favor and let me upload his documents to KYC on these exchanges.

Now I'm in a situation where I want to pay the taxes on these gains, but don't know who is supposed to file.   Obviously people will tell me to consult a lawyer, but I've already done this and received conflicting advice from different counsel.

The problem is

If we file on my father's name, it's my money, I'm ultimately going to be the one to spend it in the future, and it could look bad that I now have all this wealth and have never paid taxes.

If we file on my name, since I was the one who made the money, there could be an issue that the exchanges have my father on record having made all this money and he never paid taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't get a definitive consensus from the attorneys I've spoken to, so I thought it might be useful to ask a group of people.   I would really appreciate any thoughtful responses."

1622757093,Bitcoin,"Newbie postHi, I have to admit that i'm very new in Bitcoin reality and I have a question about security.

I have got an Electrum wallet and made a first deposit there. Is this safe space? Because as I have seen, it's secured by 12 words passphrase and password. But later I tried to get access to my Electrum wallet from another PC, entered my passphrase, and password wasn't actually required.

Does that mean that passphrase is enough to get access to my wallet? How sure can I be that nobody will ever guess my passphrase, for example by brute-forcing random passphrases to get access to wallets? Is this even an option?

I'd really like to secure my wallet more. Can you recommend something? 

Sorry for being stupid but I need advice :D"

To me, buying and hodling was not the point of bitcoin or crypto. It was made to be used for something. 

Even though I'm happy about the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency awareness generally, all the talk about investing and getting rich is such a major let down. 

I understand that now the talk has transitioned into a ""store of value"" sort of thing / ""digital gold"", but remember when the people who had bitcoin mined it and exchanged it for a purpose other than price speculation? Gambling, buying shit on the internet, whatever else? 

In a bizarre way, I feel like we've regressed, BTC use cases are totally different. 

Now that organizations like Coinbase are releasing bitcoin debit cards I guess you can finally ""buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin"" but the whole landscape has morphed.

So much I see now concerns financial instruments and the super wealthy. 

I found an old wallet today that I used to pay 0.4 BTC for an old ledger nano when BTC was $250 at the North American Bitcoin Conference in 2016. How things have changed.

Anyway curious how others feel about this change. Or even if you think there was a change."

Or does the transaction goes and sit in the pool of transaction?

If it goes and sits in a pool of transactions and if the miner picks both the transaction inside the same block, at that time also he can't reject the transaction as the existing blocks would show that Alice has 10 BTC's. If that miner is able to find Nounce and add that block to the chain then while other miners validating it then will it be rejected or in earlier case only? In the latter case, it can go into an infinite loop."

1622749538,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is not a democracy and we don't vote for updates.I remember in the past, I compared updating your software or signalling for a feature as voting, but I realise that Bitcoin isn't a voting machine and this is important to understand IMO.

Bitcoin is more like an activism machine -- but a much more direct one, because instead of taking action to cause a change, this type of activism is more like taking action to be the change. 

Everyone can run a variation of Bitcoin's protocol, and if enough people want the same thing, Bitcoin will adopt that change. Change is most effective when people are organised and can collaborate, but Bitcoin doesn't facilitate this, we use the internet, social media, and anything else we can to facilitate this instead.

When we signal for a change, we are just using Bitcoin to communicate, but we are not making any changes, we can even build in an activation policy to make it feel like signalling is the voting mechanism, but everyone needs to play their part. They can't just signal and then not act according to their signal... well, they can... and this is why you don't know people's intent until the feature is released. Signalling is just a tool to help further increase awareness and to communicate people's preference, assuming no ill intent.

Voting is too limiting, when you vote for something, there are only a handful of options to vote from and none of them are perfect, but when you see an idea and don't like something about it, you can choose to write your own interpretation and deploy that instead. Again, without collaboration, a single user is not very effective, Bitcoin adopts the wishes of the many, but allowing Bitcoin to be the referee is a very interesting effect.

Ultimately, if everyone did what they wanted when they wanted, the network might not work very well. We started from a base policy and worked our way up. We also organised ourselves, allowed open criticism, and we proved that people around the world CAN collaborate and create order from chaos.

The same system is used for mining transactions too. Someone can refuse to mine a transaction, but someone else can do it instead. If everyone agreed not to mine a transaction, Bitcoin will not mine that transaction, and if over 50% of us **really** don't want to mine that transaction, we can even try to reject blocks with the transaction within it. I'm not advocating for censorship here, I am showing the power of activism in Bitcoin.

Keep this in mind when comparing Bitcoin to PoS and other solutions, because these systems do work by voting. Although some solutions involve randomness to pick the ""validator"", they will rely on voting for things like punishing them. Voting is a blunt tool to allow someone to control the options and force people to choose between them.

TLDR; Bitcoin does not achieve consensus by voting, I'd say its more like activism; everyone advocates for whatever they want to be the change they want to see, and although coordinated activism is better than not, only a coordinated change that everyone is willing to enforce is ever a change that will survive in Bitcoin.

I needed to write this out because it felt like a eurika moment. Hopefully it is helpful."

Happy to be corrected in any context :) 

My question is ‘Where is the ‘value’ coming from?’ 

I’ve always asked this and the answers have ranged from ‘you don’t get it’ to ‘where’s the value in fiat’ to promises of a utopian future etc but in all honesty the main value in any given coin appears to be via speculation at present. Would I be correct in assuming that we are just buying X$ equivalent of a coin and hoping it becomes a utility in the future that people rely on and thus having amassed a (hopefully large) amount of it. That this makes us a holder in a valued commodity ? 

Is this the correct way to view it?"

I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE’S the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here, it would be cool if you added your country, but no pressure. I will send you some sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  with the amount and the cost of the transaction. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and is probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press «open in Wallet»), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press «withdraw using webln», and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees. 

-go read about lightning Network!

-Lets keep this going: when you are done, if you can, return as many satoshis back to me as you can, that way i can give them to more people, and we give them the same experience.

**② Bitcoins are not being consumed and can be fragmented without functional consequences.**

**③ Bitcoin's value is not being regulated based on the price of real goods of services.**


➔ Bitcoins generates zero real world earnings (contrary to e.g. company shares), beyond pure speculation.

➔ There is no functional difference between owning 1 Bitcoin or 0.00001 Bitcoins (contrary to e.g. gold), beyond pure speculation.

➔ Bitcoin's price is continuously based on arbitrariness (contrary to Fiat of responsible nations). The Bitcoin that buys a yacht today could very well not worth a bread tomorrow, simply as baseless speculation dictates as demonstrated in the past weeks - again.

#Conclusion: The entirety of all Bitcoins is entirely **WORTHLESS** for someone who doesn't want to be part in a pyramid scheme that has absolutely **ZERO** basis on real values and that destroys the environment at insane proportions."

1622936354,Bitcoin,BTC may become legal tender in El Salvador
1622936353,Bitcoin,"I'm from El Salvador and I'm here to clarify some things about the BTC adoption recently announced.Hello, I'm from El Salvador so I'd like to give you all some information that might help you clarify things. I posted this in another thread and made some slight edits. 

First some info of the current zeitgeist in El Salvador: 

The president's party, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas), was formed in 2018-2019 as a new alternative to the old bipartisan, marxist-left (FMLN) and ultranationalist right (ARENA) system that had controlled the government since the end of the Civil War in 1992. He won the presidential elections in 2019 with 52% of the vote (overwhelming majority) and just recently won the legislative elections in 2021 by a landslide (73% of the vote). That means that his party controls the Congress with 2/3 of the legislators, which are enought to pass any bill that they want, and in fact that's what they've been doing. 

His party is made up of mostly young professionals tired of the corrupt system that has kept the country poor and underdeveloped for the past 30 years. In just their first day in office they fired the Attorney General (who had been protecting other corrupt politicians) and 5 other magistrates, accused of being bought by the oligarchy to protect their economic interests. In just a month, the new Congress has approved unprecedented financing for education and infrastructure and has passed bills that make sure that the predatory economic elites that used to buy politicians in the past are kept in check. Many big infraestructure projects are expected to be approved by Congress soon, including the construction of a high-speed railway and a new international airport.

One of the biggest projects that the government is building is called Surf City, which is basically road, electricity and communications infrastructure along the coastline to help small businesses. In fact, for this very reason, the ISA decided to hold the World Surfing Games (which are happening until tomorrow) to qualify for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics in El Salvador. Bitcoin is already used by small businesses in this area, especially in El Zonte, which is one of the more popular beaches that gets a lot of international tourists.

I know most people used to have the notion that El Salvador was a dumpster fire, because we were. However, the country is going through huge change. Just yesterday the ex-mayor of San Salvador (the capital) was captured by the police and is awaiting trial for corruption and gang financing and also the ex-first lady was sentenced to 10 years in prison for money laundering. El Salvador is no longer on the top 10 list of most violents countries in the world (the muder rate used to be 12-15 homicides daily and has decreased to nearly 3-4 daily since Bukele took office) and our economy is expected to grow steadily too. 

Bukele (39 years old) is extremely popular, with an approval rating of over 90% during his second year in office. Mostly due to this forward thinking. You can see this with the data related to the pandemic. El Salvador is the Central American country with the lowest mortality rate (due to a massive revamp of our healthcare system), the lowest number of COVID-19 cases and the fastest rate of vaccine applications, having just surpassed the 2 million mark. The government also just launched a project to give laptops to 100% of the students of the public school system. The country still has massive challenges to overcome but I'm confident we are on a very good path.

The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is HUGE news for this country. I assure you that Congress will pass this bill. I couldn't give you an exact date, but the economics commission will probably receive all the papers this week. 

I'll try to answer any questions that you guys might have.

1623015032,Bitcoin,"Thoughts on El Salvador adopting BitcoinEl Savador is looking to become the [first country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57373058) in the world to switch to Bitcoin as a currency. 

There is some sound logic in this move. The country's currency has been pegged to the USD for the last [20 years](https://ticotimes.net/2021/01/04/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse) and 23% of its GDP is [remittances](https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b) from abroad and around 10% of that money ends up in the hands of money transmission services. 

Switching to Bitcoin allows for a nearly 10% increase in GDP by simply skipping the overhead involved in the legacy money transfer system. 

It also switches the country to a monetary system with a predictable supply that is outside the control of any political organization.

Jack Mallers is a young kid who [enabled this](https://www.coindesk.com/strike-launches-bitcoin-lightning-payment-app-in-el-salvador-full-eu-support-is-next) in El Salvador.

His story is an interesting one. I only found out recently he was a competitive Chess player too. The first 2 minutes of this video are worth checking out to learn more about him - [Interview](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1043779351?t=435s)

This sounds like a good thing for Bitcoin. There will be increased demand for it as people move some of their money into BTC for remittance to El Salvador. From there on, that money can stay in BTC as it moves through the El Salvadoran economy. 

Some of those who are compelled to buy BTC for remittance might also find it useful as a means of some of their savings. 

I imagine some of the other [66 countries](https://www.avatrade.com/education/market-terms/what-is-currency-peg) whose currencies are pegged to the USD are watching with interest."

Dubbed the Daymak Spiritus, the car will be the first car in history with mining hardware and cryptocurrency technology programmed into the user interface.

The car, being electric and coming equipped with solar charging capabilities, boasts it is emissions-free, both for driving and cryptocurrency mining, putting the Tesla Bitcoin objection problem to rest.

“The Spiritus car is for those who want more in life, and we are committed to putting our customers ahead of the curve. We envision a future where your highway tolls, your parking, and your drive-thru order will be paid directly on the fly with crypto. Your online bills and your banking can be handled through the same software platform paid in crypto. And whereas most vehicles are depreciating while they sit in your garage, the Nebula Miner will make you money while your Spiritus is parked. The potential applications are limitless,” stated Aldo Baiocchi, President of Daymak.
“It is not just about building LEVs. We have positioned our Daymak Avvenire series as the LEVs of tomorrow, and tomorrow’s vehicles will feature an array of technology systems seamlessly integrated for the convenience of the driver. Daymak has been a champion for disruptive technologies since its inception, and the current crypto movement is a clear indication that by the 2023 Spiritus release date, we will be in the midst of the blockchain revolution. Everyone will be paying with crypto by then, and we are building these cars with that in mind,” added Baiocchi.

“Daymak Spiritus is more than a car.”"

1623013923,Bitcoin,"Jack Dorsey Unveils Square’s New Plans For A Bitcoin Hardware WalletToday, Jack Dorsey took to his Twitter feed to announce financial services company Square may be adding a hardware wallet for Bitcoin. Dorsey claims that if the project moves forward, the entire design and development will be open source and in collaboration with the crypto community.
Square is considering making a hardware wallet for #bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.
The Twitter thread explains that while exchanges have the best intentions for their clients, they cannot give them full control over their crypto. So bitcoin exchange balances are really not much more than IOUs when conditions are sufficiently hazardous.

Jack’s plan is to develop the idea of “assisted custody”, where management of crypto assets would lie somewhere between the current best practice of self-custody (where the user maintains 100% control and bears 100% of the risk) and exchange/managed custody (where custody is controlled by a third party).
Jack closed by saying he and his team would be evaluating feedback and that if the project were to move forward that he would be setting up dedicated social channels for it."

1623013713,Bitcoin,"1 Trillion Leaves Cryptocurrency Market Cap In Just One WeekThe cryptocurrency market cap is down approximately 1 Trillion dollars from its all-time high of 2.5 Trillion on May 12, just one week ago, a price depreciation of nearly 40%.
The sharp declines come on the heels of Elon Musk sending several critical tweets regarding Bitcoin energy usage and a false but widely circulated claim that China had banned financial institutions from servicing bitcoin-based businesses.

Taking a month’s view, Bitcoin dropped nearly 50% from an ATH of $64,000 on April 14 down to a low of $32,000 earlier today.

Ethereum briefly lost over 50% of its value, dropping from $4,300 on May 12 to $2,092 today before bouncing back to its current price of $2,660.
But will the carnage stop?

CNBC’s ‘Chartmaster’ Carter Worth envisions Bitcoin hitting a $29K low:

Cornerstone Macro’s Carter Worth appeared on CNBC this week and stressed that he thinks the current price is a top support region. Worth, who is also called the ‘Chartmaster’ sees BTC dropping 55% from the crypto asset’s high. 

I think we’re in support— it’s fighting, but my hunch is it goes lower.

Worth is not alone in his thoughts on the new Bitcoin price range.  Delta Exchange’s CEO Pankaj Balani thinks Bitcoin will stabilize in the $35K to $38K price range.

“Despite a sharp correction and BTC price trading in the support zone of $42,000-$44,000, we don’t think bitcoin has found a floor yet,” Balani said.

And Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote in Gland, Switzerland, said, “The next important support level stands near $37,000, then the $30,000 mark. There is a chance that we see a pullback to these levels and even below, at least in the short run.”"

Another FUD attack tomorrow and we could easily see 28k 

In my opinion, it’s going to take a lot for BTC to recover from everything it has going against it right now. 


Also, I don’t believe this about shorting the price so institutions can “buy the dip” I think things happening now are much bigger and the powers that be don’t want Bitcoin to succeed and are doing everything in their power to see that happen. We grew way too fast in a short amount of time and caught the attention of the world. Too much attention isn’t always a good thing especially when it’s detrimental to how the governments regulate and control everything (especially our money). 



For now, I’m patiently waiting to see what the trend and sentiment of BTC becomes.

What I am interested in is if someone can explain to this ape just how they tracked down this bitcoin payment and more importantly, SIEZED it?  I mean, I thought that wallets, even hot wallets, would be encrypted with seed phrases and 2FA, etc. etc.

Did they seize BTC whenever the known wallets tried to move it from their wallet to another and basically highjack the transaction before it could be written into the blockchain?

I won't apologize for not knowing the answers, but I hope they are good questions that lead to a real discussion about the future of a decentralized BTC.

Banks use those dollars to pay of their debts to the federal reserve who prints those dollars. You take out the cost of using banks the cost of goods would crash.

1623198771,Bitcoin,"best trading platformThis is the best trading [platform](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419).
There are certainly many ways to profit in the online world, and each method has its own strategy.

 That is why one of the methods that I am going to show you today is so effective that you cannot find similar methods in the online world.

Which is how to invest your money and trading to earn more than $150 so I decided to bring you an amazing place called Antares. The site is very popular in the world and offers good service.

The site offers many different ways because it is a very big treasure to get a trading robot through the site. You can also invest your money on the site and get good money from the site.
What is [Antares](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419)?
Antares is a platform for investing in the digital market and companies that use the recommendation system model.
Profit from Antares depends on two ways:

First method:

  Paid After you purchase the package, some investors manipulate the invested money to make a daily profit for you, and after the package period expires, you will get the full benefit, usually three times. of the amount paid in advance. The platform feature is nothing but a team building system. Second method:

The site is network marketing if you invite people to nominate the platform you use the earnings on the platform if those people are owned by other people after you nominate you also get income from their deposits etc.
This is just an example of the site plans, you can invest in this site for $100, for 200 days you will get 5 percent return every day. This is a very good thing because the company invests and trades heavily and has good plans to distribute the funds among the investors. You can also find much less than that which is highly dependent on the larger programs. You can invest in a site of $50 for 280 days, and you have a good profit rate of $146 per day. That's cool, say just fifty bucks put it on the site and forget it, there's more software on the site.

Just choose the type of investment you want, and you can make money.
To see how much you get in 284 days or less, simply put the required amount in the $100 box and scroll down. You will find that the net amount is 298 which is a good thing, that is, you are simply waiting for your profits from the site at the end of the specified time"

The fed prints money
The fed lends the money to the banks for a fee
Banks have shareholders who get paid in dividends
Banks lend that money out to customers for a fee
Customers buy things with that money
When they spend that money they have to buy from a business that uses a bank. If they do not eventually someone else will. 
That business pays a fee. 
That business adds the cost of the fees the bank charges in to its prices. 
So the customer is paying for the businesses bank account. 
The fed also buys assets like mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds. 
The bank charges the Fed a fee. Even if they did it for free the fee would be charged to the other customers.
The bank takes those fees to pay it’s costs of operation and debts to the federal reserve. 
Let’s not forget the bonuses!
Whatever is left over goes to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Politicians are shareholders in the banks. 
Politicians voted to print more money to get everyone spending money. So the fed had to print more money and lend it out charging EVEN more fees causing prices to go up which means the people have to pay more! The more we spend the more fees get collected, the more the banks can afford to pay their shareholders and the more their earnings/share goes up. 

Now you have money you want to “save.” You give it to the bank. Because of fractional reserve banking they get to spend 90% of your money. The more they spend, the more fees they collect, the more dividends their shareholders get. When the pandemic hit and they started printing money they told the banks they could spend 100% of your money however they wanted. So EVEN MORE SPENDING, EVEN MORE FEES, EVEN MORE DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. Don’t forget a lot of politicians are invested in banks! Either directly or indirectly through ETFs and/or hedge funds or other means. 

Politicians vote to lend money or just give money to other countries. 
They lend them dollars. 
You need to use the same bank technology to spend those dollars in other countries. 
The bank gets a fee. Those dollars eventually end up with the bank and in their shareholders pockets in the form of dividends and earnings/share. Remember politicians are shareholders in banks! 

Now when a bank lends out money they charge a fee because of “risk.” 
Unless I’m wrong they take on 0 risk because if you have it in your bank account they still get to use it to spend and collect more fees. If you spend it they collect a fee. And who you spent it with will spend it for a fee or put it on his bank account and the cycle continues. 
And all those fees go in to share holders pockets. Politicians are shareholders in the banks 


Bitcoin eliminates the federal reserve and the need for banks. Less fees, cheaper prices, less politicians getting rich by passing laws

1623194185,Bitcoin,"The bitcoin money supply is not fixed, and even if it was, this isn't an good thingAbandon the ""fixed money supply"" dogma already. I can give you three basic reasons:

1) The money supply is the money base times the money multiplier. A fixed money base doesn't imply a fixed money supply.

2) The quantity theory of money, which says that MV = PY, where M is money, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level and Y is the quantity of real goods. A fixed M doesn't imply a fixed P.

3) Deflation is worse than inflation. Deflation causes recession or hyperinflation. Bitcoin is at increased risk of deflation.

1623193970,Bitcoin,"Using 401k to purchase CryptoHello everyone. First time poster here.

The purpose of this post is to receive constructive criticism as well as important feedback regarding my current action plan.

For the longest time I've been contemplating on creating a Self Directed IRA/LLC to be able to have more control over my 401k portfolio. I'm 27 and have built a nice nest egg in my 401k throughout my career at my past employer.

For those not familiar with the topic of SDIRA (Self Directed IRA/LLC), to make a long story short it allows you to roll over your 401k account into an IRA that owns an LLC (that you can manage) without having to pay a 10% penalty for not meeting the age requirement of 59 1/2.

This type of account also give you the ability to invest in crypto/real estate/common stock/precious metals etc.

After careful consideration and research for some time now I've made up my mind and began the process.

Logically since this investment route allows me to ""drive the bus"" with my retirement money, this option is a lot riskier than following the traditional 401k route and for that reason I will only roll over 50-60% of my current balance leaving the rest to grow the traditional way.

Another thought I've come across is that one of the most important factors for investors is ""time"" and with me being 27 I figured I can afford a calculated loss if this SDIRA idea did not workout and still save for a good retirement.

As far as investing within my SDIRA I'm thinking a safe route would be to dollar cost average into crypto/stocks, another thought I came across was perhaps staking to generate passive income but I'm not very knowledgeable on the topic currently.

If you've read this far thank you, I would appreciate any feedback regarding this information."

I sincerely doubt that they are going to just talk about outright banning cryptocurrency, rather they just want to heavily regulate all global crypto exchanges/vendors and make them report all large transactions to prevent bad actors from exchanging crypto and so they can recover illegaly obtained bitcoin.

This is bad news for criminals that want to get paid in bitcoin, but there will always be ways that they can circumvent this with most probably opting to use a privacy coins instead.

Why would they ban bitcoin when they thing they can control it and tax the fuck out of it. the worst think that could possibly come from this is some retroactive crypto tax.

This ""heavy regulation"" they've been talking about will just make institutions more comfortable investing in crypto and also increasing the likelihood of the SEC approving crypto related ETF's."

If I have fiat for less than the treshold (? $200K) in a Bank saving account that is FDIC insured, I am guessing I will get my money regardless if the bank goes bankrupt?

I believe BTC is treated more like an investment, so it is not insured?  

Just need to start somewhere, even if it is not ideal (like Paypal), while I get familiar with the whole crypto basics.  


Also, secondly, if the above is a not currently insured, which reputable &amp; legal US companies that that trade (buy/sell) BTC with a reasonable fee ?...1.5% to buy and another 1.5%  to sell is kind of steep, but that's maybe my interpretation of reading a company user agreement/policy.

It doesn't really seem like a good idea to me. I'd rather hold on to my Bitcoins and pay for stuff with Reais like I've been doing up to now. What do you think?

2) How long is long enough to HODL? Are we talking months, years, decades, forever? I don't intend to become a day trader or time the market, that's a losing game. But I also wonder when it's okay to try and turn a profit, considering that inflation and other factors are likely to make my investment grow in relation to ""official"" money in a period of several months. I'm not looking to cash out completely - on the contrary, I hope to have more bitcoins at the end of the year than I currently have - but when is it okay to HODL a little less and regain some fiat currency that I can actually use?

3) Wallets and interests. My Bitcoins are currently sitting in a wallet owned by the exchange. In order to withdraw, I'd have to pay a withdrawal fee. While they sit in that wallet, my Bitcoins aren't really ""doing"" anything. If I withdrew them to a local wallet, they'd also sit idle. Which is safest? Also, I've heard of ""Bitcoin investment"" accounts that function just like savings accounts, earning a modest interest. That would also involve putting my Bitcoins out of my hands and into somebody else's but at least I'd be getting a little something back. What is generally considered to be the best way to store my BTCs out of these three? Is there another better option or another way to gain interest or dividends on my Bitcoins?

I know that with the small sum I have currently, these things probably won't make any difference for a long while, but I want to start off on the right foot, even if this is information for the future. I'm really excited to become a part of this and I thank you in advance for any and all replies. I'm also open to tips, constructive criticism and advice of any kind. Thanks for reading this far and may your profits be high!"

Can the divisibility be increased indefinitely or are there some hard limits beyond block size (which can be increased, within reason)?

Also, would there be any downsides, beyond the memory problem, of actually implementing such a change?

I'm aware of the possibility to take care of those things on a second layer, but maybe when hyperbitcoinization at some point occurs, it \*could\* make sense to be able to settle smaller amounts than 1 satoshi on the main chain, right? Even if we're talking many decades or more in the future, I would still like to know about the feasibility of such a change.

1623357918,Bitcoin,"Top Biden Advisor Tim Wu Is a Bitcoin MillionaireTim Wu, top advisor to the Biden administration on technology and competition policy, holds more than $1 million in cryptocurrency, shows a recently filed financial disclosure. The antitrust expert, who is known as a prominent big tech critic, has in the past questioned the value of bitcoin.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s tech advisor, Tim Wu, is a millionaire in bitcoin, Politico wrote in article this week, quoting his personal financial disclosure. The declaration has been provided to the publication by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, which requested the document from the White House.
According to the disclosure Wu owns between $1 million and $5 million in bitcoin (BTC) as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in filecoin (FIL), the cryptocurrency of a platform that offers decentralized crypto storage services. The official information also reveals that Wu’s bitcoin investment is the largest holding in his financial portfolio.

Wu now serves as a special assistant for technology and competition policy to the president at the National Economic Council. In March, he went on leave from his position as a law professor at Columbia University to join the White House. He is considered a strong critic of the growing power large tech corporations wield."

1623357850,Bitcoin,"India’s Supreme Court overturned the Bitcoin ban that prohibited banks from servicing cryptocurrency exchangesIndian state officials are reportedly no longer keen on banning Bitcoin and a crypto regulatory bill may be up for discussion during the Monsoon Session of Parliament.

The tide may have finally turned for cryptocurrencies in India as reports indicate a softer stance by the government toward crypto.

According to a report by The New Indian Express on Thursday, the government’s hostile stance toward Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be shifting toward more common-sense regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies.

According to inside sources quoted by the publication, authorities have dropped earlier plans for a blanket Bitcoin ban in favor of classifying cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India will reportedly be tasked with overseeing crypto regulations in the country in collaboration with the finance ministry.

These inside sources also claim that Parliament will debate a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill during the Monsoon Session beginning in July. An expert panel created by the finance ministry is reportedly studying protocols for crypto regulation and its finding could form part of the parliamentary deliberations next month."

They use smoke screens and mirrors to disorient us, to turn us against each other, to willingly give up our rights and freedoms. 

“It is the American government, not the people, which needs supervision” - Will Spencer.

Left to our current trajectory, the future looks bleak. 

Then came #Bitcoin . 

Perhaps the greatest invention in human history. Bitcoin fixes this.
Bitcoin restores our freedom, our privacy, our hope for a better future. 
Bitcoin is the great equalizer.

#Bitcoin  will liberate citizens all around the world from inept and corrupt governments. It will restore the very thing it aims to remove, trust and faith. 
Billions around the world will gain access to the world economy.

Billions will learn what it means to save, what it means to work towards a better life, what it means to have opportunity. BILLIONS will gain hope, will gain freedom, and will gain independence. 
The world as we know it will never be the same.

The dominoes are falling. 
Change IS coming. 
History will NOT look back kindly to those who stand in the way. Will you be a part of the revolution? Will you contribute to a better future for your children and your grandchildren?

1623456594,Bitcoin,"Mixed feelings about el Salvador adoption; radical change often is unhealthy changeIt seems that the leader of El Salvador is taking a very extreme measure because their situation is so volatile. The different things he is saying seem to be half baked (great goal and great direction, poor planning and poor collaboration). Everyone must accept as legal tender. 100% green energy mining. Powered by volcanos.

Here's why I think compliance is going to be very hard. It's a great idea to have Bitcoin as a legal tender but to require acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment means that people who do not know the technology are going to be very quickly frustrated and annoyed and the lack of information and clarity and collaboration makes this whole thing probably very alienating. Add on top of this that for a lot of people who do not use electricity for their sales imagine any fruit cart that doesn't accept debit card or credit card but only accepts cash they must now accept electronic payments. If you are rural and low income, and your livelihood just got complicated all of a sudden by some, young, urban politician you're not going to like this change.

This has nothing to do with whether I think this is good for the country I think it is. But it's the psychology and economics of the social exchanges. This is very hard and it's going to make you very unpopular and it is the kind of thing that makes thousands if not millions of people ticked off right away."

1623449920,Bitcoin,"Using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Here's Why: (x-post from r/cryptocurrency)I posted the following post on r/cryptocurrency because I was looking for a debate.  Perhaps here people can add to the arguments I have made:  
 
The ""PER transaction"" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  

* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   

* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these ""per transaction"" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda?   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  

* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   

* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.

 The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't ""wasted""  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  

The bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and I believe it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of ""per transaction"".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.  
  Or take a look at x-mas trees lights (https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)  They can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries.  But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  

Using a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just ""per transaction"" so be suspicious of anyone trying to promote ideas about bitcoin based on them."

1623448766,Bitcoin,"Why I think Argo Blockchain is the future of bitcoin mining.Argo blockchain is a crypto mining company that focuses on green energy. They are helping to lead a miners coalition and push for renewable, sustainable mining techniques. They focus primarily on hydroelectric power, but have been setting up more wind powered rigs in Texas. They mine bitcoin, and zcash. Here are the reasons why I think Argo is the future of mining.

1. Margins are insane, they profit about 80% + for every coin mined. Just goes to show how much energy consumption matters. They can still remain profitable when bitcoin is 8k.

2. Diversified company, with stakes in Defi(WonderFi) also in NFTS

3. Peter handles ignorant questions well( See CNBC interview) Peter Wall has a background in media and is a great face for the company as well as a growth oriented CEO.

4. More institutional support, added to Bitcoin etf MSCI, IMI, black rocks ishares

5. NASDAQ listing is in the works to attract more American investors.

6. Argo has a similar hash rate to MARA  with 1075 peta hash (1.075 exa hash)

7. Texas facility being built = higher hashrate, also an expansion into wind power further sets them apart from fossil fuel miners.

8. More transparent than any other mining stock(I’m talking about you 🆘) Peter will answer any investor questions on his YouTube page, and they release frequent updates.

9. Absolutely no debt. Mara owes about 387,000$) Nuff said.


I personally think Argo is going to be best in class. Practically all the other miners use unsustainable techniques to mine their coin. As the push for green mining increases I can see RIOT and MARA falling behind. They may mine more coins, but Argo does it better.(imo)

Question 1. 

I see many people say that cyrpto will take over fiat currency, or eventually even make it irrelevant. Is this the general consensus around the community? How so, If cyrpto derives it's value from fiat?

2. Taking from the 1st question. How is it that if cyrpto derives it's value from fiat currency that it can remain decentralized? Would putting it in govt and financial institutions hands would lead to regulations? 

I had I 3rd question typed  but I answered it myself. About new crypto currencies appearing so quickly. 

Now these are the 2 questions,I have that I believe many people have along with the explanation of why  they should pick a currency and which one, and how it benefits the world. 

A concern I have not necessarily a question is that in order for crypto to grow and be sustainable as a store of value and help trade especially for impoverished nations, which from my understanding is it's purpose, then then it needs rapid widespread adoption for it to be achieved.

As soon as I saw big coin start dumping in mid to late may (as well as this past weekend), I was certain that once the money settled from the sell off, it would find its way back into the market. Sure enough it did. TLRY is one of those memers that has sort of been lagging since the last short squeeze of early Feb. It's definitely due for another run. It'll be interesting to see what happens to big coin &amp; our beloved memerzs after this weekend. The G7 summit is this weekend, and there has been growing pressure on Biden to speak about big coin taxation &amp; regulation. It's perceived as a threat to the US dollar. Especially with El Salvador adopting it as legally tender; it's only a matter of time before all of Latin America starts to buy it up (essentially guaranteeing a profit in a similar fashion to what Musk did when announcing Tesla's purchase of it).

TLDR: Pay attention to the G7 Summit and how it affect the big coin &amp; meme stocks."

1623439506,Bitcoin,"Is it a problem that P2TR is more expensive (fee wise) than P2WPKH?According to [https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/](https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/), a non-script transaction is about 1.5% cheaper if done by P2WPKH compared to P2TR. One of the benefits of P2TR is that script outputs become indistinguishable from normal transactions (unless the script is needed). But if it costs more to do normal transactions, won't that just mean the only people using P2TR are probably using it for script transactions?

I appreciate that even if that was the only benefit, it's still better than in P2WSH in many ways, but am I missing something? Are there other reasons why P2TR may become the more common type of transaction?"

1623438309,Bitcoin,"International Monetary Fund authorities are shocked by El Salvador's law to make bitcoin legal tender, are all central bank authorities raising ammo now?Unsurprisingly on Thursday the IMF has attacked President Bukele, saying that adopting bitcoin ""raises a number of macroeconomic, financial and legal issues that require very careful analysis."" Already we are seeing stiff resistance from the international central bank authorities with countries like Turkey completely prohibiting bitcoin to China where strict regulations bar its citizens from transacting in crypto, but mining activities are still allowed.

The IMF was designed to guarantee the stability of the world's monetary systems after WWII to prevent the worldwide economic depressions in the 1930s. The IMF was supposed to prevent unilateral decision-making that could cause currency devaluation. They failed their mission in 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. The US dollar has experienced an 85% inflation since then. The move by the US influenced other currencies to move to a ""floating standard"" model that is the value of the currency is determined by current market forces.

Currently El Salvador is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF. The IMF's rhetoric has caused concern with international bankers who've raised their interest rates on El Salvador's debits. This sends a very clear picture that central bank authorities are feeling threatened by the possibility of bitcoin becoming one of the world's reserve currencies."

I've been lurking over buying BTC for ages, could have been a millionaire had I bought in when I first learnt about BTC; been a skeptic and a believer after that, but mostly a skeptic probably due to me trying to make myself think I was right being a skeptic and that BTC was a scam - born in the 90s, everything is a scam to me. 

I'm seeing the huge opportunity of this current dip and really want to buy in, but I'm broke AF, need to move house (so even more broke), living on a tight budget, debts and shit, and obviously little to none disposable income. 

I know the main rule of stock and crypto is to invest what you can afford to lose, but I have this massive FOMO and, like most of you have said, this is a huge opportunity and probably never going to happen again, at this price. 

Is it worthwhile if I invest £500 now? I can probably borrow and get £1000, which I'll pay off eventually, but with some effort.

1623534600,Bitcoin,"[BITCOIN] The best Support/Resistance work you've ever seen! 

https://preview.redd.it/zq9xshntnw471.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3072dc33524f5d52a0283cd286e6ffe61dce7679

I know this chart seems very difficult to read at first glance because of the number of lines it contains, however, this may be the best support and resistance work you have seen in years. I don't know if there is another chart like this out there, but I want to make it clear that I didn't use any other work or graphical analysis as a reference for creating this ""chart"".  


This analysis was quite bold on my part, I always looked for patterns in everything in my [life ](https://br.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-VIDA/)but I couldn't believe that today I would find a possible pattern in something that could completely change my life and from many other people, maybe change yours, but that will only happen if you read what I'm writing and understand this chart.  


I dubbed this graph or analysis the ***Landz Logarithmic Curve*** after my name ""Landzz1"". I would like to mention that I still don't know if I put this work in Analysis or Educational since I will be explaining the idea trying to bring some theoretical points to support it, whatever!  


First, what is the **Logarithmic Scale**?  


According to Wikipedia, a logarithmic scale is a scale that uses the logarithm of a quantity instead of the quantity itself. Presenting data on a logarithmic scale can be useful when the data cover a wide range of values. The logarithm reduces the representation to a scale that is easier to visualize and manage. In the graph, as you can see, the farther to the right we look, the wider the scale becomes, and the farther to the left we look, the narrower it gets.  


***Whatever***, I'm not the Sherlock Holmes to stand here unraveling mysteries! I just want to know how to read this!  


Analyzing BITCOIN from 2011 to 2013 and also **Bear Market** that happened after December 2013 I could verify using the logarithmic lines that the price fluctuation *(up and down) of* this period does not quite correspond to the period we are going through. You can notice the difference in width from one line to another ( *Supports and Resistances* ) drawn on the first logarithmic scale (from the left), about the second (from the right) which is the one we are at now. **However**, I said, however, from the moment we concatenate each other, we can see in an **AMAZING**, **ABSOLUTE,** and **MAESTRAL** way that in which the supports and resistances are interconnected with each other. For **each line** intersection, if we draw a straight line to the right, we can see that it is part of a BITCOIN price support or resistance.  


As we can see in **Image (1)**, a horizontal line was drawn at the intersection points from the white line which is the line of which the ""**Top (All-time High)**"" is located, and as we can see, the result is ridiculously right.

 

Image (1)

https://preview.redd.it/x3z8ogywnw471.png?width=1467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576f973c6aae4e9d86f92f133ecdecfe161258e0

To further clarify the color scheme of the lines, from **red dotted** line to **white** line. **Note:** (The white line is not dotted as it is seen as the top of the logarithmic pattern). So, it's like from bottom to top, and the **blue lines** are part of a continuation so we can use it at intersections in a future projection.  


Now I will enter a point from which I bring the Logarithmic Spiral theory. Also according to Wikipedia, The logarithmic spiral was studied by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), who called this curve spiral mirabilis (Latin for marvelous spiral). The curve that forms with all the straight lines, located in its plane and passing through a fixed point of that plane, a constant angle. In practical real-life examples, we can find the logarithmic spiral in shells, hurricanes, and in the galaxy itself (the Milky Way).  


*Note: You can see in the graph that, as mentioned above, from the white line (the only one that is not dotted, top-line ""ATH"") all the blue dotted lines successively are considered as periods, where the colored lines of the current logarithmic, when they intersect, they will become support and resistance.*  


Although this analysis was done using the **1W** time period **as a base**, it is possible to **Zoom in** on a **1D** time period for example, and draw the horizontal lines at the intersections to find each of the supports and resistances. **Image (2)**.  


It's interesting to see how the lines narrow along the way due to the curvature of the logarithmical pattern, and yet the supports and resistances are there! **Voilà!**  


Image (2)

https://preview.redd.it/xd010j61ow471.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dc1fce37c0842d44a63db5773ec006e08af0b85

 In the next image, I'm going to bring in a three-dimensional aspect for people to see how this really looks like galaxy stuff. In **Image (3) it** is possible to see the logarithmic curves as if they were the rings of Saturn.  


Image (3) 

https://preview.redd.it/o8jgxc64ow471.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa97093583cb9e58dbcb7e3a03a9898f5a7476e

Finally and to finish this analysis as being the best support and resistance analysis you have ever seen in your life (just kidding, but maybe) I will show you the current path of BITCOIN and where will be its support and resistance lines that it will follow in the future. When the candles of Bitcoin moves to the next blue line, it will have support and resistance at the **Pink** horizontal line. See **image (4)**.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I end here my analysis of BITCOIN and I hope you liked it! Prepare yourself for the future, I'm not giving a value that the BTC will reach either up or down, but I'm already showing where all its supports and resistances will be in the future, so you can find the targets that best suit your analysis.  


If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your patience, and if you work in any financial company or crypto company where is needed a professional analyst to draw and read macro charts even for day trading, please contact me, I would love to work for a company in this field. I am currently unemployed and that sucks!

[Twitter lightening button ](https://preview.redd.it/iqwwh165xv471.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab852e984eb739fcc2db0c40938b596891d440fd)

Each account would be able to register the address of an off-Twitter LN wallet into it, you could then donate some satoshis for any tweet you see through your own off-Twitter wallet, something like Brave do in their browser with BAT. 

It could be made in two ways: 1) a direct channel between the user and the donator or 2) with Twitter as an intermediate.

If it is a direct channel, I don't see how Twitter could verify if the transaction was successful or the one who clicked to donate didn't complete it. This would be bad for social media-wise since it would be only a wallet option without metrics.

If it has Twitter as a middle-man, the transaction could be made as donator -&gt; Twitter | Twitter -&gt; receiver. The address of the LN wallet would be private then, with Twitter being the only one to know it. The donation of satoshis through lightning would make the tweet appears for more people, something like Likes, Retweets, and Replies do, it could appear as X enlightened this tweet instead of liked/retweeted/replied, or could just make the algorithms better for the other ones. Twitter could receive a small fee so that would be profitable for them, let's say 1% and the minimum donation of 100 satoshis. 

The number that appears on the tweet could be the number of satoshis (or an unit of 100 satoshis, that is, the smallest donation possible) or the number of people who donated.

Twitter would build a major global financial integration. People who need help could easily receive financial support from the whole world with a single tweet. 

The Share tweet button could be moved to the three points up there."

1623522914,Bitcoin,"One of Hal Finney’s last posts on bitcointalk.org. RIP. It gives me hope. You should know him. Cypherpunks Never Die!Bitcoin and me ( Hal Finney )

March 19, 2013

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

1623621250,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin questions for a...friendWhile I'm an avid user and hodler of BTC , I'll be the first one to mention that I'm a laymen when it comes to blockchain technologies nuts and bolts (I do however feel fairly competent around basic level blockchain concepts). 

As such, I am hoping to better understand some details I've researched but failed to retain. Please excuse my ignorance as there might be some gaps in my knowledge.

\- Where does the widespread acceptance and adoption of the lightening network fall into BTC's hierarchy of necessities? Will off chain transactions be required for scalability? Why hasn't this network become the norm? Is there a downside to implementing it?

\- Will BTC always stick with POW? I understand there is somewhat of a fallacy surrounding BTC's massive energy consumption, but as an environmentalist myself, is changing to less energy dependent system going to detract from what BTC has to offer?  Would changing to POS or a different validation system hurt BTC's efficiency, value, or adaptability?   


Side note: As far as those who resist a change away from POW as changing to a different system would be straying to far from the tech's original form -  I'd prefer not to get into a conversation of BTC dogma. This is more a question of logistics rather than ideology."

1623620643,Bitcoin,"New age of mercantilism?So let's imagine that statewide adoption of Bitcoin continues to spread from Central America and South America until it's the world's reserve currency. What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade? 

I'm honestly just thinking aloud here and don't have a fully formed opinion on the matter so I'd love to hear some more perspectives! Thanks!"

1623617708,Bitcoin,"PSA. With taproot locked in, it is a good idea to upgrade your full nodes to Bitcoin Core 0.21.1With taproot officially locked in since the last difficulty adjustment:

    bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo

     ""taproot"": {
      ""type"": ""bip9"",
      ""bip9"": {
        ""status"": ""locked_in"",
        ""start_time"": 1619222400,
        ""timeout"": 1628640000,
        ""since"": 687456,
        ""min_activation_height"": 709632
      },
      ""active"": false
    }

and active from block 709632, it is a good idea to upgrade [the full node to 0.21.1](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/) since it is the first version fully supporting taproot. [Version 0.21.0 had taproot coded](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.0/) but no knowledge about the activation mechanism. 

The final activation will not happen until November but it's now time to be prepared. If you don't upgrade, the old nodes will consider the taproot transactions as ""anyone-can-spend"" so they will continue to work but without validating their correctness.  

It is also a good idea to upgrade wallets to versions that support new taproot bech32m address format.

For example, Electrum wallet supports bech32m since [version 4.1.0](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/4.1.0/RELEASE-NOTES)."

It's about cutting Iran and other U.S. enemies out of the equation. Iran, Russia, and such countries have a lot of oil and gas supplies which they cannot sell due to U.S. sanctions. Bitcoin gives these ""evil nations"" a financial relief--they can burn oil for Bitcoin.

But the U.S. Empire scheme feels threatened by Iran burning oil for cash. So? What to do about it? Well, if the NSA could hack Bitcoin they would have. So apparently they can't. But what can the secret services do?

\- shove forward Craig Wright the ""creator of Bitcoin"" to try to seize Bitcoin patents and trademarks

\- setup a Bitcoin Mining Council which, in the future, will approve who may or may not mine Bitoin (cutting out Iran)

\- let El Salvador (a U.S. satellite state) mine Bitcoin with its yet unused vulcanic powers, namely to out-compete Iran, etc.

\- increase the Bitcoin FUD to Elisabeth Warren levels

\- use BTC funds confiscated by the FBI over the years to short the BTC market &amp; make people lose a lot of money

\- and so on

1623715590,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin = PetroDollar 2.0One of the biggest reason why the US Dollar has the power it has is due to the Petro Dollar system. This system makes the US dollar the biggest currency for oil trading in the world. Because of this, the US dollar is literally backed by oil.

With leaders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk looking at using renewable energy to mine bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially becoming the petrodollar for renewable energy.

Regardless of how you feel about Jack and Elon, bitcoin will be used for renewables. As Jack said, Bitcoin is a great incentive for renewable energy. Considering that all energy usage must be used on the spot or stored for later usage, any excess energy on top of that is wasted. Bitcoin fixes that problem. It allows for anyone producing energy to make an extra income by using the excess energy to mine bitcoin. With bitcoin becoming literally integrated into renewable energy systems, bitcoin is positioned perfectly to be the next biggest currency backed by energy.

Those who say proof of work is pointless and kills the environment is wrong. Nonrenewable energy is what kills the environment, proof of work is just a means to use energy. Combining proof of work with renewables is a match made in heaven. No pollution, more incentive for green energy, and more power to a network that is controlled by no Government.

Edit: TLDR; Bitcoins proof of work algorithm will be used for renewable energy. This will cause Bitcoin to be directly tied to energy production and essentially be backed by energy. This may cause bitcoin the be more powerful than the petrodollar."

What solutions are being proposed/implemented by these countries to make it viable - without using any/many Layer 1 transactions?

Are they using Lightning?

Are Banks providing BTC accounts, and then settling transactions on L1 occasionally with each other?

Is it something else?

If bitcoin started roughly in 2008 at 0 and just peaked at   say 65000, then the recent dump obviously, can someone help me with the math please, I hear other people with more conservative estimates like 35%, I'm using this formula but it doesn't work:

&amp;#x200B;

**To calculate the percentage increase:**

1. First: work out the difference (**increase**) between the two numbers you are comparing.
2. **Increase** = New Number - Original Number.
3. Then: divide the **increase** by the original number and multiply the answer by 100.
4. % **increase** = **Increase** ÷ Original Number × 100

How do we get 150-200%?"

I’ve been super diligent with this app. Anytime I make a big purchase I check if the store is on Lolli. I’ve even been spinning their daily wheel to earn like $.10 worth of sats per day. After 4 months I have earned $80 and $27 of that is finally available to cash out. 

I go to cash it out, enter in the Bitcoin address and at first it sends me an email I need to confirm before the transfer goes through. I confirm it and the it says there was a problem and the transfer was cancelled. Now anytime I go to transfer it says “This quote has expired. Please start your transfer again”

Something inside of me told me that thing thing was never gonna let me transfer the money out. But I just had to try it since I’ve been recommending it so much to no-coiner friends as a way to get started earning a little crypto.

It ranges from finance, sports, comedy, and anything that sounds interesting to me. Just today, two separate podcasts under two separate genres had extended segments on Bitcoin being an environmental disaster that shows the shortsightedness of human beings and how a corrupt politician like El Salvador’s president embracing it just shows how it’s useful for criminals and “bad guys” only. I was so sad because I love the pods and hearing their ignorance was disappointing. Then I perked up at the realization that, honestly, this is just a reflection of how early we really are. I think it’s easy for us (at least me) to believe my echo chamber of the books I read and subs I follow are reflective of a larger consensus than it actually is. Talk to you parents, grandparents, siblings, coworkers; look at mainstream media; this is more reflective of reality. The massive majority of people are either (1) totally clueless, or (2) grossly misinformed.

1623882257,Bitcoin,"What Makes Bitcoin a Store of Value?
**A cup is not being useful when it sits in the cupboard, only when you drink from it. A bicycle is not useful when it sits in the garage, but when you ride it.** We can say that a bicycle or a cup are useful items, even when not currently in use, but it **is the ability to make use of them when needed that grants them this label of utility.**

Likewise, a broken cup or a bicycle damaged beyond repair ceases to be useful and becomes junk. This is because **value comes from utility** and not the other way around. A thing that loses its intended functionality loses its value. The broken cup may still find itself useful to the artist, but broken items tend to lose all worth and can generally be had for free… many people even pay someone else to collect their junk from them!¹

This article is about the “store of value” myth and how those who promote it are blind to the gaps in their logic. Gold is considered useful as a store of value because people know with certainty that when the time comes to actually use it, e.g., to sell it or trade it (or smelt it or forge it), that there will be someone else to buy it with little enough fuss. **Gold is useful as a store of value because it is universally regarded as something that has value.** Gold has value, and it can be an asset, but it is not money.

Bitcoin is different. It was invented, described, and marketed as a new form of money. Its only function was to serve the needs of its users by being a better way to transmit value from one person to another. It was (and is) revolutionary because **it marked the first time in human history people could transmit any amount of value across any distance or any border without the involvement of intermediaries and regulators. For the first time in human history, a person could send fifty cents from Tokyo to Tanzania as quickly and easily as they drop spare change in the hat of a street musician.** In other words, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Cash is regarded as something of high utility. It can be used at virtually any store, or traded to virtually any person you come across in day-to-day life. There are few people who would walk past a hundred dollar note on the ground without stopping to pick it up. Cash is hyper-useful because, like Bitcoin, and unlike previous attempts at electronic money, it can be given to any person, in any amount, without any oversight or permission required. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor **Satoshi Nakamoto bridged the gap between cash and electronic money by creating the world’s first form of electronic money that had all the same monetary properties as cash. But it was superior to cash, because it did not have many of the negative physical properties that can work against cash. It can’t be confiscated, torn, burned, counterfeited, eaten by rats, and it does not weigh anything or occupy any space.** Carrying $100,000 in cash or gold through an airport is risky, but with Bitcoin one can memorize a mnemonic phrase and walk around with $100,000 in their brain and no one can stop them.

More revolutionary still, **Bitcoin also had many of the properties that make gold valuable while shedding the properties that make it inconvenient.** Bitcoin takes the best attributes of both cash and gold and boils them down to their purest essence.

Like the cup in the cupboard and the bicycle in the garage, cash in the wallet or under the mattress is only “useful” insofar as it can be reliably useful at the time one wishes to use it. **A trillion-dollar Zimbabwe note held by an American is regarded as a novelty, not counted as cash-on-hand. Even a strong foreign currency held in cash will be regarded as less useful than the prevailing local currency, because it won’t be as widely accepted and one often has to carry it to a bank or a money-changer to convert it to a more useful form of paper. This doesn't happens with Bitcoin which is becoming widely accepted everywhere in the world.**

Do Bitcoin whales create any issues for its long term application as a currency/store of value/whatever you believe Bitcoin can/should be?

I understand we can eventually refer to Bits or Satoshis, but does the long term effect of a small group of people holding a majority of Bitcoin cause an issue for the health of Bitcoin?

Maybe it will eventually be more broadly distributed as people start to adopt Bitcoin, and large quantity holders take profits and sell (seems to come in waves, but it seems most will hold), but is the current distribution of Bitcoin amongst a few whales going to cause an issue with the long term outlook? Is it fair to expect a Bitcoin dump at some point, and how will that affect it if Bitcoin has been broadly accepted and all of the sudden it crashes as whales take profits (if they choose to)?

I find the question to become more relevant as the Bitcoin whales start to become large institutions, banks and companies, while normal people in the world are just living off Bits and Satoshis. Almost seems like there'd be a ruling class of early Bitcoin adopters (congrats to you) and large institutions but are there any implications in that scenario.

Just looking for some perspectives on how this would play out."

Hi 

I transfered some BTC from coinbase to Trezor model T and I notice a strange things. Can you please help me?

In  trezor suite, under account, I can see the total number of BTC in there. The balance is correct.

 But if I scroll down, under transactions, I can only see the test  transaction I make a few days ago. I can not find any info regarding  the new transaction I made today even though the total number of BTCs is  updated at the top of the app and the accounts.

If I go to BTC scan and search my address, I can see the total number of BTCs are correct.

Why , in Trezor Suite, there is no transaction info recorded? Should I be worried?

I am mining on nicehash (or rather miners are renting the hashpower of my GPUS) and being paid in BTC. I want to withdraw from nicehash to the wallet app I have chosen on my phone (BLW). I am not using lightning, just regular on chain (I think that's the right terminology)

So yesterday I did my first withdrawl using the QR code generated by the BLW app for android that I downloaded. I named the wallet in Nicehash and the wallet now appears prepopulated when I go into nicehash.

I want to make another transfer today. Can I simply preselect that existing wallet?

All I recall is him saying that the USB he gave me was Linux. I shoved a USB drive and the slip of paper he gave me into a drawer and promptly forgot about them.

Fast forward to now, and we're no longer really on speaking terms, but I could use some monies and I thought about this old thing. I am not educated in cryptocurrencies even slightly, and have spent about a week on and off trying to figure out how/what to do with this thing.

Currently, I have a USB drive that seems to be Linux formatted. It also acts as a boot drive. I also have a sheet of passcodes labelled Generation Seed, Password, and Receiving Address. 

I believe I have everything I need in order to do anything with what I have, but I have zero idea how to do it. I have a laptop set aside for playing with Linux. I just started a Coinbase account, but that doesn't seem to have the option I need. 

Anyone willing to lend a hand?

EDIT: Just to cut down on the number of replies, don't worry folks, I will not be giving out a shred of the password info or anything. From peeking at the rates that BitCoins have been trading at, historically, we may only be talking about a couple hundred bucks.

EDIT #2: Okay! Thanks all. I got it all figured out. Woo. You were all most helpful, I definitely had hit a brick wall after about a week of being mildly frustrated about it. Got things moved over to Coinbase where I find out that I am now the proud owner of... &lt;drumroll&gt; ... ... $137!

Not to mention being sent to residential schools, put up for adoption, etc. Many indigenous people nowadays are speaking out and going back to their roots, denouncing Canada and the US as a legitimate government in their eyes and only identifying with their own tribal nations and going back to their traditional governance system. Seeking actual nationhood, self-sustainability. Especially in Canada; Indigenous people are multiplying rapidly with amazing birth rates that far surpass any other demographic, they will need land and resources for their future. A future that is being sold by the Canadian government as they extract resources all around their traditional tribal-national territory. Could Crypto help with this at all?

I was trying to gift some Bitcoin to my nephew and like a lot of posts I see on here, the whole process is awkward. Trying to decide how to safely store the coins, keep them separate and also manage the keys when the parent has an understanding of Bitcoin or Crypto in general.

I came with a solution [https://getnested.co/](https://getnested.co/) which I would like to know what you guys think about!

* Nested would allow anyone to create a specific wallet for a child in which they could buy and store Bitcoin. The wallet would have a predetermined lock-up period (for example when the child is 18) that would be set by the wallet creator. 
* All of the bitcoin would be stored with a 3rd party custodial company and always be in cold storage for maximum security of the fund. 
* The account owner could then contribute monthly and also invite family and friends to contribute to the fund if they wanted to. Due to the simplicity of the wallet the fees to purchase Bitcoin will be much lower than established exchanges such as Coinbase.
* Each account would have account ""guardians"". The ""guardians"" would be family or friends that have a vested interest in the child. Any withdrawals from the account prior to the pre-determined lock-up period would have to be approved by the guardians to ensure that the child is the recipient of the Bitcoin. 

Would love to hear what everything thinks about this idea and if it would make it easier to gift bitcoin to minors"

I'm a very busy person. I'm old. I'm occasionally curmudgeonly. I don't have time at this point in my life to spend it researching and buying the parts to make a Bitcoin Lightning Node. I recognise completely that it's a fun exercise and I'm more than capable of doing the work but... I want to spend my free time with my family or enjoying outside.

But enough about me.

There is a market out there for someone to make ready to go Bitcoin Lightning Nodes that require little to no setting up. I am sure there are thousands of people in this sub in a similar position who REALLY want to support Bitcoin but are equally lazy (yes, I realise I'm a lazy bastid.)

So, please, either someone come up with a sexy looking product I can hang from a wall or tuck away in the corner that helps run the lightning network OR send me links to a reputable seller who already does this. The first two pages of Google were no help."

1623961801,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin death cross nonsenseI'm a little annoyed by the non-data-driven trading *wisdom* like selling at the typical MA50 / MA200 Bitcoin death cross nonsense. Here our current arising death cross:

[death cross nonsense](https://preview.redd.it/jjjjnxc9uv571.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45c12c715937360b177ce845feaa240ea8e04be5)

I was wondering why so many people just put up with this without doing any data-driven simulations on it. With a simple python script I have compared the death cross strategy with the bitcoin HODL strategy. Here is the result:  


[HODL vs. death cross](https://preview.redd.it/uuz4ljvgvv571.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434addca5d2cdf6dd59e58854386baaeb66b1b85)

The death cross would have turned $ 1 into $ 22,000.   


Sounds good right?   


But HODL would have given you $ 812,000. You would have missed -97.3% performance if you had listened to the death cross. Of course, historical backtesting is no guarantee for the future, but at least this data-driven analysis has brought the big picture closer to me.

I have been reading about the 24 word seed as well.

I read somewhere that if I lose my Trezor, i don't necesarily lose my bitcoins.

I can just use my 24 recovery word seed?

Dumb Question, if someone stole my Trezor, and know my PIN can't someone gain access to my bitcoins? Won't they just hook it up to the computer and wallah? (sorry, I don't actually own a Trezor, so I can't visually see what the process actually entail). Then what is the point of the 24 recovery word seed?"

1624053571,Bitcoin,"Watch what happens.When those who use real estate as a store of value begin to understand bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is highly liquid, it can be sold and bought in seconds. There is no property tax (which in my state INCREASE EVERY YEAR). It is FIXED in supply. Won’t be able to create more of it, FOREVER. 

When this happens, I believe it will create a more fair world. Home prices will become more affordable, companies like BlackRock won’t be driving away the dream of home ownership just so they can preserve wealth for themselves.

Bitcoin is a far better store of value than practically anything else.

A reminder. There’s only ever going to be 21,000,000 of these. The supply is constantly decreasing through lost coins and incoming supply cut in half. Realistically there’s only 12 million coins out there, and that’s all there will ever be.

1624052289,Bitcoin,"Bank of England’s Bailey Wants to Regulate Crypto With ‘Tough Love’Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says there will be an element of “tough love” in regulating cryptocurrency. “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: “We must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.” He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen “in a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.”

Emphasizing, “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are “dangerous,” reiterating that they “have no intrinsic value” and “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they “have the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.” Bailey elaborated, “A key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.”

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England’s work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. “We’re going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,” he said."

1624051346,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Beach Town in El Salvador Bustles With Growth After BTC Becomes Legal TenderEver since El Salvador passed a bill that was approved by a supermajority in the Salvadoran Congress legalizing bitcoin as legal tender in the nation, the country has remained in the spotlight. Furthermore, there’s an area in El Salvador called “Bitcoin Beach” with a small group of beach villagers that are attempting to leverage bitcoin on a daily basis.
The Bitcoin Beach resident’s official Twitter account has amassed more than 27,000 followers since its introduction in 2019. The account grew massively following El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele officially announcing the legal tender plans. The Twitter account shows all the action that’s been taking place in Playa El Zonte since then.

“Bitcoin Beach team working late to produce educational material for 6 million future Bitcoiners,” the Twitter account tweeted on Wednesday sharing a number of pictures of the progress. According to the residents of the village, a great number of entrepreneurs are showing up to the beach to visit or help the bitcoin economy flourish.
The residents of Bitcoin Beach have shared a myriad of photographs covering the work that’s been done so far in the area. “Desks have all filled up at Hope House Bitcoin Beach shared workspace with bitcoin companies streaming into El Salvador – So of course we are building more space,” the group stressed the other day.

“Crazy Days here at Bitcoin Beach We are thrilled and humbled by the number of companies and governmental agencies that are putting everything into plans to support the rollout of Bitcoin as an official currency of El Salvador,” the Bitcoin Beach group further said."

1624046657,Bitcoin,"SOLUTION: Solar + Hydro Powered Bitcoin, Plus Recycling InitiativeThe best solution is to switch Bitcoin mining from coal powered electricity to energy that is created by solar power and hydro power. At least we could announce this as our ""goal"" and in the coming years take concrete steps, 1 step at a time, to make Bitcoin clean and shiny like my toilet bowl after I scrubbed it with bleach containing cleaning liquid.

We could also announce Bitcoin mining hardware equipment recycling initiative, ensuring that all components used to mine Bitcoin are properly recycled, without damaging environment.

The decision to go green would have multiple benefits for Bitcoin buyers and miners:

1. Instead of being in conflict with left-wing extremists and their climate change agenda, we could simply join them and invite them to buy some shiny clean and eco conscious Bitcoin.
2. On the other hand, we could use our newly created green economy to criticize legacy financial system for being dirty, using too much coal powered energy, and destroying the environment; thus, earning credibility among eco conscious population who is sceptical of cryptocurrency.
3. Once the dust settles, Bitcoin can finally start to enjoy wider acceptance and can increase it's market dominance to a fair market value level, like $1 million per 1 Bitcoin, and then in the following decade or two, 1 Billion per  1 Bitcoin, and higher.

In conclusion, we have to be smart. We can't just swim against the tide. Tell ""them"" what they want to hear, satisfy their left wing extremist agenda, let them hear ""Yes, we care"", and then we focus on business. But first we have to tell them what they want to hear. They are narcissist, sick, demented people, and all they want to hear is acknowledgment that we believe that climate is changing, and that we want to protect the environment.

Tell them what they want to hear. Let's move forward.

Solar + Hydro powered Bitcoin with Recycling initiative is something that needs to be widely circulated, so left wing psychopaths feed their inner sickness with a feeling of vindication, followed by a feeling of Bitcoin's acceptance."

I want to accept Lightning Payment for my website, but I can't find good solution for the Lightning Payment.  Here are my current situations:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I can't run Bitcoin full node where I work: I can't open certain ports
2. I can't run Bitcoin full node on AWS (or on other servers): I can't afford the price ATM
3. But I can run Lightning Node (but I still need to find Bitcoin full node service)  


Therefore, I need to find a good custodial service for the Lightning Payment.  I found some websites such as \`[*https://tippin.me/*](https://tippin.me/)\` but it doesn't provide **REST API** for developers.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there any good idea to accept Lightning Payment for websites?  Unfortunately, I can't use Raspberry Pi to run Bitcoin full node.  Please help me out!"

1624134530,Bitcoin,"Dorsey: ‘Square Is Considering Making a Hardware Wallet for Bitcoin’The cofounder of Twitter and the CEO of the payments firm Square, Jack Dorsey, has revealed his firm is contemplating creating a bitcoin hardware wallet in collaboration with the community. Dorsey revealed this in a tweetstorm and said he wanted to share some “guiding principles” concerning this possible venture.
On Friday, Jack Dorsey tweeted about the possibility of Square creating a bitcoin hardware wallet and discussed a number of principles the firm is guided by when approaching the subject. The founder of Twitter and Square explained that what the company creates needs to be “open,” as he noted that “bitcoin is for everyone.”

“Square is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,” Dorsey tweeted. “We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market,” the Square CEO added.

Dorsey then gave those who have already pioneered the noncustodial wallet space props, and asked his Twitter followers what the “biggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people?” Numerous people answered Dorsey’s questions and a few responses discussed hardware wallets with no iOS support.
“iOS support. Trezor, up until now, still doesn’t support iOS for (good reason.) If you solve this solvable problem, you gain a huge portion of the market,” one individual responded to Dorsey’s Twitter thread.

“Custody doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing,” Dorsey continued. “We can probably simplify custody through ‘assisted self-custody.’ Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions?,” the Square CEO asked. He further added:
After Dorsey published his thread with about 12 different points, he said that Square and his team plan to “continue the conversation.” He further noted that a dedicated Twitter account would be on the way and a Github repository, as well, if the firm decides to build a hardware wallet.

“We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks,” Dorsey concluded.

Dorsey’s hardware wallet tweet has accrued tens of thousands of likes and retweets since he announced Square’s possible hardware wallet venture. The Twitter CEO also mentioned that layer 2 capabilities and Cash App integrations with the hardware wallet are also important guiding principles.
Meanwhile, after the hardware wallet announcement, Dorsey attended the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami this weekend and was heckled by a conference attendee over “censorship” and “interfering in elections.”

“Why is Jack Dorsey on a stage at a Bitcoin event in the first place?” an individual tweeted in response to the heckling video."

Raftaar, an Indian rapper, lyricist, dancer, TV personality and music composer, made headlines this weekend for being the “first Indian artist to accept performance fee in cryptocurrency.” Raftaar’s real name is Dilin Nair.
The performance for which Raftaar will be paid in cryptocurrency is a one-hour virtual event in Ottawa, Canada, for a private group of about 100 people. It is scheduled for the second week of July.
“I’ve always been an ardent admirer of blockchain technology. I’ve always wondered why artistes and managers alike haven’t explored the potential of this disruptive medium,” Raftaar opined. “Nevertheless, I’ve finally taken the baby steps in this direction and all the credit goes to my manager, Ankit Khanna for making this dream a reality for me.”
The rapper did not mention which cryptocurrency he will be paid in, however.
Khanna, Raftaar’s longtime business partner and manager, commented: “In my opinion, music will be one of the first industries to be completely and thoroughly disrupted through the blockchain. The artist can now go directly to the public in every single way without the need of middlemen.”
Meanwhile, the Indian government has yet to announce its policy on cryptocurrency. A bill that seeks to ban cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, was scheduled to be introduced during the budget session of parliament but was not. There are now reports that the government is re-examining the proposals in the bill and is setting up a panel of experts to come up with new recommendations."

Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors (NYSE: GM), talked about the prospect of the largest automaker in the U.S. accepting bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.

Referencing Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating last week that his electric car company may start accepting BTC again, Barra was asked whether GM will be accepting the cryptocurrency for payments. She replied:

There’s nothing that precludes us from doing that. We will be driven by our customers. Certainly, we want to make the whole buying and ownership experience as easy as possible. We will follow their lead.
When Tesla announced in February that it would accept bitcoin for payments, the GM CEO said that her company was not interested in doing the same. However, in an earnings call at the end of March, Barra softened her stance on BTC and said the company would consider accepting the cryptocurrency “if there’s strong consumer demand.” She confirmed Wednesday that her company’s position on bitcoin has not changed.

Meanwhile, Musk said this week that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.”"

1624127086,Bitcoin,"The World Bank has refused El Salvador’s request for help on the country’s transition to adopting Bitcoin as legal tenderThe World Bank has refused to support El Salvador’s request for help in the transition to use Bitcoin as legal tender.

It cited issues with Bitcoin’s environmental impact and transparency as reasons why it will not support El Salvador move to adopt Bitcoin as an officially accepted currency .

“While the government did approach us for assistance on Bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings, ” a World Bank spokesperson said.

The World Bank did note however that it can help El Salvador in other ways, including “currency transparency and regulatory processes.”
Earlier on Wednesday, Salvadoran Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said the Central America country had sought technical assistance from Banco Mundial (the World Bank).
Prominent Bitcoiners weren’t pleased with the World Bank’s refusal, but nor were they particularly surprised.

Bitcoin proponent Anthony Pompliano tweeted in response to the news that the “World Bank hasn’t figured out how to make money off Bitcoin.”

Samson Mow the CSO of blockchain development firm Blockstream, and creator of blockchain game Infinite Fleet, was irritated by the news — and called for The World Bank to be made obsolete.
While President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin law has sparked a lot of excitement from Bitcoin proponents across the globe, it has also received a lot of criticism. Yesterday, economist Steve Hanke said that El Salvador using Bitcoin as a legal tender may “completely collapse the economy.”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also not keen on El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin. Cointelegraph reported on June 11 that it may hamper negotiations with the IMF over a $1B loan to support the country’s economy.

IMF spokesman Gerry Rice noted the adoption of Bitcoin presents a number of financial, legal and macroeconomic concerns that require a “very careful analysis”But some companies are rushing to help. Athena Bitcoin indicated it would move quickly to provide Bitcoin ATMs across El Salvador. On Twitter today, the firm asked Bukele if “1000 ATMs ” were enough, with the President replying in jest “1,000? How about 1,500?”

Yesterday, El Salvador’s Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Rolando Castro denied claims that ministry had begun discussing the option to use Bitcoin for employee salary payments, noting that it was “too premature to talk about wages.”"

The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: “We must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.” He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen “in a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.”

Emphasizing, “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are “dangerous,” reiterating that they “have no intrinsic value” and “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they “have the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.” Bailey elaborated, “A key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.”

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England’s work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. “We’re going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,” he said."

Now, I'm trying to move all my Bitcoins from this wallet into an Electrum wallet because I simply cannot get Bitcoin Core to sync and load my wallet without problems (I've tried on several different platforms with different errors and I've given up on this route for the time being).

Anyhow, my mission is to export all private keys containing unspent transactions so that I can sweep them into Electrum. The first thing I did was to make a wallet dump using [jackjack-jj/pywallet](https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet). This gave me all the addresses starting with ""1"", some of them contained in the list of receive addresses in Bitcoin Core and some of them being change addresses. However, some receive addresses, starting with ""3"" were obviously missing from this dump.

So, I fired up a fresh install of Bitcoin Core and used the dumpwallet command to export all my keys. This gave me a lot of addresses beginning with ""3"", including the missing receive addresses from the pywallet dump. However, not all addresses beginning with ""1"" that I found using the pywallet dump showed up for this Bitcoin Core dump.

So,  what I'm left with are two non-identical subsets of keys, and I don't know if there are more that I haven't been able to retrieve. However, if I were to understand why the two programs gives me different outputs, maybe I would be more confident that I've located them all.

First of all, I don't know why I have a mix of addresses starting with ""1"" and addresses starting with ""3"". Without really knowing, it seems like my wallet is some kind of mix between a HD wallet (generating addresses starting with ""1""?) and an old wallet where each address is generated individually (addresses starting with ""1""?). Since my wallet is filled with keywords suggesting a HD wallet (for example derivation paths and master private keys), I guess this is the case. If so, I still don't understand why Bitcoin Core won't dump all of the keys that pywallet can find. At least pywallet feels more consistent, since I only get addresses starting with ""1"" (I guess support for addresses starting with ""3"" are lacking).

Further, there are two things I really don't understand. If I have a HD wallet, shouldn't I be able to generate an infinite addresses? I realize that Bitcoin Core can't print all of them since I don't have an infinite hard drive, but how is it decided which one will be shown? Some kind of internal track record of all my transactions? Also, when reading [the wiki page about addresses starting with ""3""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash), it says ""To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, the recipient must provide a script matching the script hash and data which makes the script evaluate to true."" Does this mean that the private key contained in my dump from Bitcoin Core won't be enough?

Sorry for this brain dump about my wallet dump, but I've been looking into this for months now. I would really appreciate any help."

The  market's crashed and I tell my friend, who managed to garner the least  interest in crypto, that now's a great time to buy since coins are  pretty much cheap, and that he's going to regret it when it all  skyrockets.

Nevertheless his  confidence in it seems to have been shaken by the recent drop, and in  spite of roughly grasping the value of cryptocurrency as a game-changing  tech, he keeps pussyfooting, stating that there isn't enough factual  information that Bitcoin and the crypto market are truly going for a  massive rise some time soon.

Granted,  I'm really into crypto as a ""rational believer"", i.e. I have too much  logic-based faith in it (and equal disbelief in the current financial  system) not to invest in it and hodl. Therefore I must admit don't  really follow what's going on, save for the big changes – as much as I  like crypto, my life doesn't revolve around it.

My friend on the other hand would need some concrete indicators that it's indeed going to get big soon. What would these be?

**BTC is King** \- I am not a Bitcoin Maximalist though

While ALTs definitely have a place in the crypto space, the future is certainly centered around the oldest and most well-known crypto out there, the mighty BTC.

Therefore, if you want to make money trading or investing in crypto (assuming you know what you are doing eg. selling the top and buying the bottom) the most efficient way is to cycle your money around. **However, no matter how appealing it is to sell your BTC for potential higher returns on ALTs, it is vital not to do so.** Why? I would much rather own BTC in a falling market, rather than some newly founded token, as the king will definitely recover, whilst your new investment may turn out to be a flop.

*ape language: more money goes into BTC than any other crypto; you hold BTC forever; you sell all other coins when price is good; you invest in BTC again; you HODL; you become rich rich*

Use this watchlist to help you guide the world of crypto. And while prices of tokens rise, don't become a ""moon-boy"" and turn into a bag holder.

**The China Ban**

China has taken another step to ban Crypto-currency. About 65% of the world’s Bitcoin mining took place in China as of April 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. One of the strongest critiques of Bitcoin has been a 51% attack (a bit complex, we will speak generally here) against the network. This involves controlling over half of the network and using that control to manipulate, steal, and fabricate Bitcoin. **This critique had extraordinarily little validity due to a lack of financial incentives to do so, but now it is completely removed as a possibility.**

**Financial Institutions Across China**

            Last month, China imposed new sanctions on financial institutions. “China has banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.” - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/)

            The institutions cannot advise towards registration, trading, clearing, and settlement, or any other facet involving the processing of Crypto, this means no Exchanges are allowed to operate. Inner Mongolia didn’t think these actions were enough, as reported on May 25th.

**Inner Mongolia**

“The Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission said in the proposed rules that telecommunications companies and internet firms which are engaged in crypto mining will see their business licenses revoked by regulators.” - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-inner-mongolia-escalates-crackdown-cryptomining-2021-05-25/)

            If you provide telecommunications or internet to miners, they will take your business from you. ***Read that again.***

**PANews Report**

“PANews reported on June 17, according to an insider who told PANews that the Sichuan Ya'an Energy Bureau and the Science and Technology Bureau held a meeting today and made a resolution to clean up and rectify Bitcoin mining companies in Ya’an. In addition, mine owners have been notified that due to the discussion of Bitcoin and other virtual currency mining at the meeting of the Ya'an Municipal Government in Sichuan on June 17, all power stations in the region will be shut down before 22:00 for self-examination, and the specific power-on time will end tomorrow. We will notify you later. According to news from the block rhythm, Sichuan Ya'an has implemented a “one size fits all” policy for mines, and all mines must be shut down before the 25th, including electricity consumption and hydropower disposal.” – [Release Here](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/1623943956574073.html)

            “One size fits all”, this means electric, coal, hydropower, it’s all irrelevant. If it’s a mine, it’s getting shut down. Ya’an controls 10% of Bitcoin mining in Sichuan. They were demanding the closure of 26 suspected cryptocurrency mining projects by Sunday. As of today (Sunday, June 20th), the hash rate has fallen, and the mines are offline.

**Screen, Cleanup, and Terminate**

The Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the Sichuan Energy Bureau issued a joint notice on Friday, ""screen, clean up and terminate”.

“We had hoped that Sichuan would be an exception during the clampdown as there is an electricity glut there in the rainy season. But Chinese regulators are now taking a uniform approach, which would overhaul and rein in the booming Bitcoin mining industry in China,"" Shentu Qingchun, CEO of Shenzhen-based blockchain company BankLedger

This hydropower generated from the rainy season will be wasted, it was actually more harmful to ban the mines here. The Global Times estimates 90% of China’s Bitcoin Network is estimated to be shut down, equal to one-third of total processing power.

Miners were told to shut down by June 25, which includes the consumption of electricity and the abandonment of using hydropower. 

**Eradication**

“A Ya’an government official has told at least one Bitcoin miner that the city has promised to root out all Bitcoin and Ether mining operations with a year, said a person with knowledge of the situation.” - [Bloomburg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/hydro-rich-chinese-city-is-said-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mining)

**In Closing**

Authoritarian regimes will always seek to undermine and manipulate any policy they can for their own benefit. Bitcoin mining was a profitable venture that appeared as no threat; therefore, China strove to be the center of mining, which it was achieving.

            China also has a deep understanding of technology, specifically Blockchain technology. With Nation-state adoption from El Salvador, those that are latching on to the Bitcoin Standard do so because they want non-inflationary (or programmed inflation), programmable money that cannot be manipulated or controlled by anyone. The boom of China’s hybrid Communist-Capitalism has largely been driven by their capacity to manipulate their currency and allow cheaper manufacturing to flow through their nation. Adopting the Bitcoin Standard is willfully giving up the most successful economic tool they have as a nation-state.

            The exodus of miners fleeing China from the repressive regime will largely impact the growth of another nation-state that welcomes these refugees. This will create competition in order to drive miners from one country to another, resulting in greater decentralization, and show the flexibility of this network to adapt overnight, further strengthening the core of Bitcoin.

1624217400,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is bad for China’s world domination plans.I’m throwing darts here but would be awesome if someone did the research. Just from growing up loving to play every type of strategy game devised, China is on a path to world domination, and they are realizing that Bitcoin is a factor they didn’t take into account for their 100 year plan to world control. 

Typically to “win the game” you first collect as much resources as possible. (World reliance on manufacturing) Then you start taking other’s resources from them. (Foreign investment in land and currency) Lastly when the rest can no longer afford to replenish their resources, it’s easy pickings to snap up more territory. (China is Currently flexing military power on the world stage) 

As I see what has happened over the last 30 years in Geo-politics. It’s pretty close to what China has been employing. 

Having a currency they are unable to manipulate, or control, available to the world. Puts a major thorn in the side of the plan to world domination.

Unfortunately for them it’s too late, the genie is out. Bye-bye centralized manipulations"

For example the fiat dollar is, in my opinion, backed by the assets it can buy. That is houses, computers, tech, weapons, etc. Yes the government has control over the fiat dollar (can print fiat and manipulate interest rates etc.) Now if we change what the dollar is backed by to, let's say, gold or BTC. The government can still just print more money and inflate the economy in the same way, right? The value of the dollar would be diluted, just as it would be diluted in the current system.

The sentiment from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is that they will only back digital coins that are issued by other central banks. Nationalists that are interested in protecting the value of their currency as well as the banking elite will always attack bitcoin. We have seen that happen in Turkey. Turkey's lira is experiencing rapid inflation so many of investors have started to put their money in bitcoin for safe keeping. Unfortunately Turkey has banned all cryptocurrencies.

China's digital yuan has the capability of tracking people's spending habits, where they send their money and potentially where they live. When you look at the future of digital currency, it may be headed towards the CCP's goals. There will be absolutely no freedom with spending habits being traced.

As such, I've resorted to purchasing BTC through shakepay then transferring it to my Coinbase, where I hold some as well as use it to purchase/exchange for other coins (basically just ADA). My question is, if i'm wanting to purchase ADA during a significant dip in the market, but the value of BTC is also significantly lower than where I bought it, am I losing more in this exchange than if I were to use fiat money to purchase ADA at its low cost? Apologies if this is a dummy question, but I feel like using my BTC portfolio while ""down"" to purchase a different currency may be losing money? Maybe not? Thx for any help/advice."

With all the news going on with China on their crackdown, Asian investors have sold all of their assets and many with a loss. You could see the market cap shrinking. China has just started their crackdown, who knows how many linked accounts are just waiting to get liquidated, it's a ticking time bomb. 

There might be new crackdowns in July and the entire crypto space including bitcoin can crash. This means we will have to wait on a recovery that can span for 3 years. In 2017 CNBC reported that bitcoin could reach $60,000 in 2018 but that never happened. In Dec. 2017 bitcoin was at 20k and then over the next few months it crashed to 5k by November 2018.

Just as North Korea chose to embrace the internet only for the elites, China is making a similar mistake here. As if that wasn’t bad enough, China’s plan for a nation state digital currency is similar to North Korea’s internal “internet.”  As we have discussed over and over again, open systems beat closed systems. The Chinese approach of banning an open monetary network in pursuit of a tightly controlled monetary system is unlikely to be seen as an advantageous strategic move for their citizens. But just like North Korea, this decision will be helpful in continuing to consolidate power and ensure the longevity of the dictatorship.” - Anthony Pompliano"

1624312300,Bitcoin,Bitcoin Analysis: Key Levels and Possible Targets
1624312219,Bitcoin,"Common musings of a new bitcoin HOdLer.I became a Bitcoin maximalist 6 months ago. I started buying it at $30k and kept buying it till $62k when I ran out of all my savings. I am a HODLer. I have spent a lot of time reading and understanding bitcoin. I have also spent time reading the arguments for and against it. And I feel like very few people, if any, truly understand what Bitcoin is and how it works. Following are my thoughts and honest opinions on some of the most common questions and arguments I come across online. I don't claim to be an expert, so read it with a huge grain of salt. 

1.	Is this a bull or a bear market?

Don't know, and don't care. Bitcoin is not for trading. It is for holding. 

2.	 Can bitcoin actually fail and some other crypto become more more successful?

Maybe. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility. 

3.	So why HODL?

Because I believe that it will not fail. Part of this belief is pure conviction, but majority of it is based on the timeline and on the tech, as well as human psychology. Believe it or not, a big reason bitcoin is unlikely to fail is because HODLs refuse to sell. Ever. 

4.	Is there anything that can convince HODLs like me to sell?

Aside from critical financial emergency, no.

5.	Do you know you are batshit crazy?
Yes.

6.	Are you not worried about losing all your savings?

No. I truly believe that bitcoin will not fail, so I am not worried.

7.	Do you realize you might be part of a cult?

Yes. 

8.	Aren't you worried you've been brainwashed?

No. My conviction stems from the effort I put into understanding Bitcoin and to an extent, modern economy. It made sense. I couldn't make it **not** make sense. And so I was convinced this is the right decision.

9.	Are you sure you won't regret this decision?

No, I might regret it. But I'm ok with that possibility. If there is any huge risk I am comfortable with taking, it is this. Nothing else has ever made more sense to me. 

10. Are you a libertarian or a conservative?

No. I'm a liberal.

11. Then don't you care about the environmental impact?

I do. But I believe the energy consumption is worth it. And I think this will become more evident as adoption increases. We don't question the energy consumption of banks precisely because way more people have bought into it. But the underlying infrastructure takes the same effort regardless of how many people adopt it. 

12. Do you think everyone will use bitcoin at some point?

No. Bitcoin is not user-friendly. It is not intuitive. 

13. Aside from money, what other reason do you have to put so much time and faith into this technology?

Because I can see that if it succeeds, Bitcoin will drive us into the next phase of technological progress. You cannot put a price on the value of **truth**, and bitcoin enables you to transaction with truth as money."

What should he have done?A guy I know bought a bit too much in late 2020 bc he was already up big, had a well paying job and virtually no debt/liabilities. Then...kept DCA until he lost employment in May 2021 right while BTC crashed from $65k to $40k. He didn't want to sell at the bottom, so kept waiting...til today at the worst possible time when BTC was down and no income stream but needed to pay rent and had a big a car repair last week.

Felt bad for the guy but essentially what he sold was the portion he went in heavy when it was right under $20k. So while BTC was down, his realized gains were over 50% profits. Not bad. Plus this was just a portion of his stack so he's still a HODLer as much as he can be.

Obv reckless and lucky, but what do you think about people like this who weren't in completely over their heads at the time of investment but eventually came to be due to a big life change? What should he have done differently?"

Ever since, it has been trading at a discount and has never turned positive despite a massive crash in the underlying asset.

As we know, over the last few months there have been an explosion of new stock tickers tradfi uses to get ""exposure"" to bitcoin. Square, Overstock, Microstrategy, ARK ETF, Tesla, Coinbase, the many miner stocks, and now 3 Canadian ETFs.

1624404066,Bitcoin,"A message to allOne decade and two years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new currency, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all coins are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that coin, or any coin so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure in this world. We are met on a great battle-field of that market. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their tendies that that coin might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, rich and broke, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the hodlers, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored hodlers we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of their savings -- that we here highly resolve that these hodlers shall not have bought in vain -- that this coin, under Nakamoto, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the blockchain, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

1624395584,Bitcoin,"How to keep your Bitcoin safe ?**Bought crypto at a great dip. Now what ? How do you keep your coins safe ?**

Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.**
* **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.
*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. 
*  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.
*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.
*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.
*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.
*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. It might be an unpopular opinion but for those who do not own BOATLOADS of ADA, in my opinion, I feel it is better to use EXODUS even though you get 0.8% less APY. You can store multiple assets on the wallet. Just making the entire process easier. And incase you do own BOATLOADS of ADA, you should be using Daedalus wallet anyways. Just my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.
*  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. 
* DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.

***Please feel free to add anything that I may have missed.*** 

***Cheers !***"

1624495704,Bitcoin,"Is the bitcoin halving cycle being invalidated?We are all aware by now that historically, halving dates are the start of bull cycles. This belief was further strengthened by the arrival of the S2F and S2Fx model of PlanB. 

Mathematically or statistically, the way S2F and S2Fx were done is pretty dubious. You can further read about it here. [S2F](https://www.coindesk.com/why-the-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-valuation-model-is-wrong)

To summarize that, the S2F model is too linear or too predicated into a single aspect of asset valuation. 

That S2F model may have work in determining 2013 and 2017 runs because retailers are still king during those times. With the arrival of institutions and corporations and even nations, the valuation of bitcoin may not be as easy as before.

So, that prompted the question, are we are already in the process of invalidating the four-year cycles? Meaning, halving dates' impact will be getting lesser by the days and bitcoin will now be traded like a usual asset like gold, fiat and etc. Wherein cycles are determined by different macro things, not only stock-to-flow ratio.

I think this can be confirmed if we will continue to be below $50K for the next three-four months, and then we still end up creating a new ATH next year. Although, a much harder confirmation will be a new ATH by 2023 or simply, a weak bear market. 

The invalidation of the halving cycles has a lot of pros and cons. But the biggest thing for me is simply the possibility that bitcoin will now be traded just like how every other store-of-value-assets are being traded.

That way, we can have a much clearer picture of how it really differentiates itself from gold and fiat."

1624495240,Bitcoin,"One BENEFIT of a market downturn: You can save a TON of $$$ on your taxes with this one simple crypto loop hole**One benefit of a market downturn:** You can save a TON of $$$ on your tax bill for next year with this one simple crypto tax loop hole. Let's discuss...

If you sell or trade your crypto when it is below the price you originally acquired it for, you incur a capital loss. Capital losses get deducted from capital gains on your taxes, and overall, they reduce your taxable income for the year.

**E.g.** Let's say you bought bitcoin at $55,000 a month ago. If you sold or traded that BTC at market prices today ($32,000), you would lock in a capital loss for the year and significantly lower your taxes.

But it gets even better: Because the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property and NOT as a security, ""wash sale"" rules do not apply to crypto as they do for stocks. This means you can buy the BTC that you sold back immediately and still realize the capital loss.

This is even MORE important if you have incurred gains earlier this year. Remember, capital losses deduct from capital gains on your tax return during the year they were realized. So if you've already ""realized gains"", you should take losses if possible to offset these gains.

**E.g.** Let's say you traded ETH for [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) at the height of the market. In doing this, you realized a taxable event and likely huge taxable gains as ETH was at all time highs. However, now your [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is underwater (worth less than you got it for).

So, if you sell out of [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) today, and then immediately buy it back, you will realize losses and offset a lot of those gains that you realized from your trade of ETH to [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) This could save you a TON on your taxes. I know someone who reduced his tax bill by $43,000 by doing this!

This is a process known as Tax Loss Harvesting, and it's a strategy rich people use all the time to lower their capital gains tax bill every year (more info [on TLH here](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting)).

Also, you can use crypto tax software tools like CryptoTrader.Tax or BitTaxer to automatically detect your biggest tax savings opportunities for you. (The tools cost money, but you can test them out for free)

**So in summary:** Take a look at your current positions and see if there is any opportunity to ""harvest"" losses. Doing this proactively can lead to HUGE tax savings for next year."

In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters’ views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters’ views generally on whether the Exchange’s proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters’ views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets’ susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters’ views of the Exchange’s assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that “approving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk” associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that “the manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.”20 What are commenters’ view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, “\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.”21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters’ views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange’s assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters’ views on the Exchange’s statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange’s assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust’s bitcoin “is not particularly important”?

Because everyone dream to be rich one day, and Bitcoin made everyone believing in it.

If that crypto could really exist wich extraordinary fundamentals would it possibly have ?

Firstly it has to be a store of value to make it comparable to Bitcoin. I'm not comparing bitcoin to Ethereum or others defi crypto/blockchain. Because I really believe that Bitcoin is more to compare as a store of value, where ETH is a decentralise system. 

When I think to a ""store of value"" I think to a limited in number crypto to make it a valuable crypto.
Secondly if we follow the initial purpose of Bitcoin creation, it has to be an easy usable crypto by everyone in the world. 

To make it possible it would logicaly need to be : scalable, secure, fast, feeless and ecological.

No need to explain why it has to be secure, but why feeless ?
Because if we want BIG BIG performance we need this crypto to be adopted by a really large amount of people. And to make it use by everyone in the world this crypto has to be 100% free for every transactions. 
Why ? Because paying 0.1/0.5/1/2/3/10/20 etc. dollars each times we buy something isn't imaginable because it would be a real problem for every little payments and poor people adoption. Imagin if your bank would tax you 1$ for each payments you do ? It's simply impossible to afford.

Why ecological ? Because if all the umanity use this crypto as an everyday payment, it's unthinkable to believe that each futur transactions would cost an anormous amount of energy, growing even more each time the bigger people's adoption it become.

1624492112,Bitcoin,Sounds about right.
1624491963,Bitcoin,"Do as the King ?Would it even be possible to take down the king of the king ? I'm not sure about it but what I'm sure about is that everyone would dream to find another crypto that would do the same performance in the futur.

Because everyone dream to be rich one day, and Bitcoin made everyone believing in it.

If that crypto could really exist wich extraordinary fundamentals would it possibly have ?

Firstly it has to be a store of value to make it comparable to Bitcoin. I'm not comparing bitcoin to Ethereum or others defi crypto/blockchain. Because I really believe that Bitcoin is more to compare as a store of value, where ETH is a decentralise system. 

When I think to a ""store of value"" I think to a limited in number crypto to make it a valuable crypto.
Secondly if we follow the initial purpose of Bitcoin creation, it has to be an easy usable crypto by everyone in the world. 

To make it possible it would logicaly need to be : scalable, secure, fast, feeless and ecological.

No need to explain why it has to be secure, but why feeless ?
Because if we want BIG BIG performance we need this crypto to be adopted by a really large amount of people. And to make it use by everyone in the world this crypto has to be 100% free for every transactions.

Lets say i have ledger nano s holding btc eth and 2 other alts that work on their platform but they are all stored with same ledger, same wallet with same seed words. How does the seed words coordinate with btc blockchain, eth blockchain and the 2 altcoin blockchains. Like i know each word in the seed words is a number so all 26 words create a giant code number so that code number identifies your share on the btc blockchain, and that same number identifies your share on the eth blockchain and so forth? Is that how it works?

Another follow up question is if i have a wallet lets say nano s, i use it and then drain it empty so theres no crypto on it. Then i close the wallet reset the ledger, and throw away old seed words. What happens to that wallet it no longer identifies anything and is shut down and lost forever? Like those seed words can never be generated again to identifies one owned portion of crypto on a blockchain?

Any food for thought it appreciated sorry for long question"

1624580722,Bitcoin,"By popular demand: a deep-dive analysis of media sentiment surrounding bitcoin over the past 90 days (3/25-6/23),We will analyze Bitcoin’s news conversation over the past 90 days, and determine whether it’s currently overhyped or if now is the time to snipe.

In 2021 $BTC price has followed a head and shoulders pattern, starting the year at $30K, doubling to an elated peak of $63K per coin in mid-April, and falling back down to the $30K-$40K price range in recent weeks (the past 90 days are shown in the chart above). Some speculate that this puzzling performance is indicative of institutional manipulation (search “Wycoff BTC” on Twitter

One thing is for sure over the past 90 days: Bitcoin has gone from an emotional high of significant optimism to one of the most pessimistic and fearful tickers on the internet, and it has taken the entire cryptocurrency market with it. As of today, the investor sentiment Fear &amp; Greed Index points to “extreme fear” 

over the past 90 days Bitcoin news sentiment has trended definitively downwards, falling below the neutral line from optimistic to pessimistic just last week.

Overall, $BTC was still more optimistic and less speculative than both the FAANG stocks and S&amp;P 500 in the news over the last 90 days.

we can see a clear correlation between the weekly price of Bitcoin and its news sentiment and time-sense.

Bitcoin’s news sentiment showed a 0.496 correlation with price (considered significant), and Bitcoin’s news time-sense showed a -0.766 correlation with price (a strong correlation) over the past 90 days.

news is more reactive and past-oriented when things are going good, but when things take a turn downwards, news articles tend become more speculative. 

So where does this leave us?

This is the part of the report where we determine if Bitcoin is currently overhyped in the news (and due for a correction), or if it’s underhyped and time to put some money into it. We call this our Hype-Or-Snipe scale, 

Based on our analysis, we have determined that Bitcoin is currently SLIGHTLY undervalued in the news, and receives a Hype-Or-Snipe rating of +0.05.

1624569726,Bitcoin,"Received free Sats from Cashapp. Time to give it away on Lightning.I will help you onto lightning by giving away bitcoin. Seriously. (I stole this idea and post from someone else)

Lightning Network gets a lot of fud even here in this sub. I suspect a lot of you guys haven’t yet actually tried it. It really is a lot easier than i think most people expect, and here is me trying to prove it. 
I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE’S the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here. I will send you 200 sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  and if I don’t get to tired I’ll post how many Sats it cost to send. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and are probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press «open in Wallet»), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press «withdraw using webln», and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees."
1624569712,Bitcoin,"Trying to Orange Pill an Older Relative by Giving a Formal PresentationHi Bitcoin Team!

I've got an older relative and I want him to increase his bitcoin position to around 5-10% of his portfolio, while making possible for him to sleep at night and ignore the media FUD/ volatility.  He has a small position in Bitcoin rn but he gets annoyed whenever I talk about it.  He's funny because he tells me I'm obsessed when I bring it up. So I don't bring it up, and then he brings it up!

I told him that I'd like to just have an in-depth conversation about it in a few days and then after that, we can shelf the conversation entirely.

So here's where you come in! I'd like to prepare some google slides that I can present to him formally and when I make them, I'd be happy to share them here for your use as well.

I need links to short video clips from influential people, quotes, and links to important charts. (Money supply and other charts about the financial system/ no TA, although I'll explain S2F to him)  


This is the structure I'm imagining right now, which I'm hoping to abridge into a 20-30 minute presentation:  


1) Quick overview of the financial crisis from a macro perspective. Just the main points, skipping over stuff he already knows.

2) What is QE?

3) How this was a backdrop for Bitcoin to be created

4) A brief overview of Satoshi, Cypherpunks, and the Sound Money protocol/ how it works. (the ledger, the halving cycle, mining, the difficulty adjustment, cryptography, and fully validating nodes)  I don't want to go to deep into any of this, so I'll probably make some comparisons to things he can understand and just scratch the surface. He should be left with the idea that this is new technology and pretty exciting stuff.

5) Stock to Flow, what is it and how bitcoin has tracked the price.  I'll tell him about Plan B, the anonymous Dutch institutional investor, which is an interesting story.

5) The interest rates in Europe going negative, what that means, and how we're headed there in the states.

5) Quotes from Billionaires on Bitcoin. I'd like to gather some one-line quips from Ray Dahlio, Stanly Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones.

6) Explaining a Store of Value, the properties of money from Preston Pysh's inteview with Robert Breedlove, and why bitcoin's hard cap and decentralization positions Bitcoin to uniquely be the best store of value humanity has ever created.

6) The best short (around a minute) Michael Saylor Video Clip. After which, I will explain that Michael Saylor is a MIT Alum, Billionaire CEO/ early investor in Apple, who understands networks and networks effects on a master-class level.  I will tell him about Michael Saylor's position in Bitcoin on his company's balance sheet, how he doubled down during the recent dip, and what he's doing to bring in the institutional investors.

7) A short clip of Jack Dorsey's interview at the Bitcoin Conference. ""absolutely, its the only way out""

8) A short clip of Chamath Palahaptiya calling Bitcoin ""shmuck insurance"" on the news.

9) Energy FUD and why Bitcoin incentivizes clean, cheap energy. Changing the bird's eye perspective on energy.

10) Bitcoin in El Salvador, the lightning network, and a brief explanation of Bitcoin's game theory. I might tack on the reasons that I don't like ETH and why altcoins are irrelevant for him. Quick explanation of layered money.

11) I'll maybe close it with the idea that bitcoin is a speculative asset class, but it is also a growing network, with the intrinsic value being the network itself.  I'll explain that just like a Microsoft words utility is to help you make documents, Bitcoin's utility is:

Sound Money without Centralized Manipulation

Store of Value

Transfer of Value/ Settlement

Smart Contracts

Second Layer Network Technology

Financial Sovereignty for the Unbanked (and banked alike)

Access to a growing Asset class without real estate, wall street, or any third parties.

And we're barely scratching the surface.

  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Anything you think I missed from a deep orange pill perspective?  Anything you think I should skip? and finally, please link any convincing charts, video clips, or websites that might help me make this?  


Just to clarify, I'm not trying to make y'all do the research work for me, but I'd like to make an awesome short presentation and I know that your perspective will help me craft this into a banger.  Maybe I'll even turn this into an Orange pill vid when all is said and done and I'll happily share the google sheets."

Are you aware that the adoption of bitcoin as a currency means that at some point (since a currency is generally used to transmit the information for some exchange of value) you are actually eligible to an equal amount of value to the amount of bitcoin you possess? 

Whatever inflation can happen with $ or € is nothing compared to when some of the whales starts to spend their bitcoin. Martin Shkrelis overpriced drugs are harmless compared to this leverage the bitcoin industry has.

I see bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) dead in the water if it isn't correlated to any existing distribution of value of the whole market or some part of market. Bitcoin is to small right now to really see that effect but the moment some countries have adopted bitcoin as a currency you guys have to be very responsible spenders if you don't want to be responsible for an upcoming crisis! (I'm just guessing that almost none of you whales has any participation in any real world economic endeavor proportionally to the amount of bitcoin you possess.) Thus the more bitcoin is spread the more there will be resistance in adopting it.

Disregarding the already scammy vibes of a giveaway like this, I set up a cash app account and entered. A little more than an hour later I received a notification that I had ‘received’ $10 worth of btc(0.0028591). So I think, ‘cool, let me go ahead and add those stats to my actual wallet. I go through the additional verification steps required for withdrawal, only to discover that the minimum amount for withdrawal is 0.001 btc. So in order to actually withdraw the giveaway sats I would be forced to purchase an additional .00071409(about $25). 

Much disappoint. It’s not a giveaway if you can’t actually take possession of the thing being ‘given’ without purchasing something. Not your keys, yadda yadda. They should have just framed it as a discount/limited time only promotion. “Buy ____ amount of bitcoin and get an additional $10 worth free” or whatever. Rant over."

2) it ironically solves claimed environmental problems as well as potential problems with global semiconductors supply

3) even if governments themselves take over mining in order to censor transactions - we can always change hash function (imposing huge losses on them rendering all ASICs useless), which is what I’m pretty sure they quite aware of

Shouldn’t it be all good news? Even banning banks from dealing with crypto is good - they would just turn Btc into glorified stock.

At least a few years back , biggest problem for Bitcoin was transaction speed. It could take days to validate transactions at the height of 2017 madness. 

Has the above problem now been solved? If only partially solved, then what % are we talking about now, 50%, 80% or 20%? As I understand the Lightning Network has been implemented more than a year ago by now. Is Bitcoin transfer speed now competitive with Visa or we are still far away from that point? Because the way I see it, if transaction speed problem has been solved then the only issue remaining for Bitcoin adoption is energy use and government regulation (only two out of three remain).

Bukele is widelly being made fun of for saying ""Every business has to accept Bitcoin but doesn't have to receive it"" This is obviously correct, as merchants have the choice to instantly get their payment converted to dollar, but taken out of context is a great line for haters and propaganda makers.

The 30$ dollar airdrop is being criticized because you need to use the government app to get it (Which has id + facial recognition KYC)... ""what will they do with our data?"" Even if is completely optional and you can use any LN app you like. At the same time they criticize Bitcoin because it will suit criminals and money laundry... I just don't get it.

I am really intrigued how this will play out. Only 90 days of implementation and education are really optimistic and I can understand the fear of those in El Salvador who have no idea how BTC works and what it is. I really wish this does not backfire on BTC.

Would you take out for instance 38000 bitcoin as soon as you see it hits 38000 in let's say a week from now, take the profit you need (8000) and then put back in the remaining 30000 you have left (the current value) when it goes down again to that value in let's say 10 or 12 days from now?

1624656660,Bitcoin,"Some of you need to read this.There is currently a BIG effort by governments (specially China and the USA) to try to kill or severly hamper BTC and other forms of Crypto.

Taking the money printing power away from them in currency and a store of value that is decentralized, unhackable, fast, reliable and universally accepted spells really bad news for them.

The current price drops are prodcuts of this (there are already many posts detailingf the massive shorts). We will see MANY more attacks in th efuture and a whole lot of FUD. (my ""classic"" financial news sources and analyses have been full of it the last week when they would't even acknowledge it's existence before).

If you put more money into it that you require for your daily life for the next 6 months or more, it's gonna be pretty rough. Reconsider just putting in what you want to save for HODLing for 2+ years.

Remember 1 BTC =1 BTC. If you believe BTC will hold it's value in the long run, then just forget about it. In 5 years you can check back and find you can afford a whole lot.

The news always focuses on the negative aspects for BTC but governments (specially CHina) has never liked Bitcoin.

The reality is:

* BTC is now legal tender in some countries with more to come.
* Financial institutions have invested in BTC.
* There is a much wider awareness of the ""common folk"" of what BTC is and they want to get into it but fear they are ""too late"" (spoiler, they're not).
* Companies are starting to buy BTC and other Crypto (mainly ETH) to hold as an investment and crucially as a store of cvalue to hedge against hgeavy rising inflation.
* INflation in the world is going to unseen levels in many couuntries due to so much printing and the effect of the USD on other currencies will create a domino printing effect. They can and will continue to print a LOT of money while BTC is only a finite amount hich is known to all.
* We are still at least 2 and a half years away from the next halving (which will increase the value even more).
* China banning mining is great news for everyone but the chinese miners.
* No one person or group has control of BTC supply (no one can create more).
* It has broken it's biggest obstacle: People have given faith and value to BTC in spite of it being ""just code"" and not a physical token created by a bank. The acceptance of BTC will not recede, it will only gain in time.

My point is: If you understand and think about it rationally, BTC has surpassed all the previous attempts and the facts are there of it's continued growth, acceptance and use. The previos gains in the year were proof of it and it will skyrocket once the conditions are set for it. If you can HODL for what you have, you will have done your future self an incredible favor, but don't invest what you need or will need in your daily life as that creates a lot of anxiety which makes people check like crazy and suffer a dip to 35,000 without realizing the valu it had just a year prior."

Hello ,

I've created this project inspired by the work of Einstein , Satoshi Nakamoto and the movie In time . a combination of a meme and a serious project to make Time a universal currency.

Official Time on mainnet : [https://time.market](https://www.time.market/)

&amp;#x200B;

What is $TIME?

Inspired by the movie ""In Time"" , Time has become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in ""time capsules"" ( wallets )

How ?

Time-keepers distribute TIME Every one elapsed day ( 86400 sec ).

They are incentivized by every second after a day expires. It's not about how much resources they use to mine but by how much incentive they may lose

Once the Time is distributed, the crowd can buy it from the Time Bank ( the time source ) then traded in secondary markets."

Given the current positive trends regarding Bitcoin (institutions, financial elites and governments of small countries warming up to it) despite the China and Elon nonsense, I and many others project the adoption/desirability of Bitcoin as well as the (fiat) price of 1 Bitcoin to skyrocket within the next 5-10 years. By that point, you will have entered a small elite of super wealthy individuals who got there because they took a risk today; owning 1 BTC will put you in not be in the top 1% financially, but top 0.1%. 

It's only a matter of time before the current financial system (which is currently creaking off of the legacy reputation of the United States and US Dollar) grinds to a halt during this crisis period and we have to reinvent it entirely.

We want new people interested in BTC and crypto and if they all believe this is going to dip, they won’t enter the market and…. The correction/dip will continue. We need buying pressure, not selling.

When we start hitting all-time highs, are you really going to care that you bought at $25k vs $30k?

$65k to $30k is the dip. Start buying and stop talking about the hypothetical lower price you’re going to buy at. Some broken record advice… DCA.

Not the smartest move but I don’t need the money for a long time and I knew this might happen when I got in. I’m prepared to hodl long term. It’s still not easy though. I’m pretty sure I’m not the only one in this boat around here and I thought it would be nice if some of the OG’s around here would do us noobs a huge favour and tell us stories about when they first got in, how hard it was to hodl and how happy they were when major gains started to come in type thing. I would really appreciate the encouragement and promise to pay it forward one day when I’m a bad ass OG like you. :)

1624740252,Bitcoin,"Are a lot of people doing leverage trading with bitcoin?I have noticed this behavior before, not just with bitcoin but with other cryptos as well. Some people do leverage trading, as in used borrowed money in the hopes of amplifying their returns. As a collateral they must own at least 30% of the asset. This is called margin trading and some platforms can charge 6% interest. When the price of bitcoin goes down significantly and the borrower has no money or feels pressured, the borrower then has to sell all of their bitcoin.

Massive liquidations can happen due to large leverage tradings. In that same process, people who buy too high stand to lose over 50-60% of their money in a period of a week."

1624736883,Bitcoin,"Thoughts about market environmentWe are in a bear market and it will probably take a few rocky months until we see a rally, maybe towards the end of the year. 

Reasons: (1) Many people are shifting from saving to consuming as the pandemic is slowing down and life as we knew it is coming back. (2) China banning itself from Bitcoin is a big deal. If you believe that the value of Bitcoin is strongly related to the number of users and the network effect, a ban of 1.5bn users means that the value of Bitcoin has to decrease. (3) China banning miners is also a big deal. Less miners means that the hashrate/difficulty decreases and the network becomes less secure, therefore decreasing its value. (4) The narrative of this bull market was institutional investors and the “wall of money” coming in, but the ESG component of Bitcoin was underestimated.

I think China’s ban of BTC is ultimately a strategic move to position the digital yuan as the new world reserve currency. We might see a new digital “cold war” with Bitcoin as reserve currency of the free world and  government CDBCs in autocratic regimes.

I’m still very bullish on BTC and the crypto market, but it could take a while until the market recovers. Mining will move to US and other locations and will be cleaner, settling up for a new bull run. History has shown that Bitcoin always comes back stronger."

1624735400,Bitcoin,"Blockchain.com Scammed Me...don't use blockchain.com. so this is my story with blockchain :

on  December 22, 2020, I mistakenly deleted the Google Authenticator app from my phone and couldn't recover it, and unfortunately, I lost my Blockchain Exchange account 2Fa 

when I realized that, I immediately requested blockchain to reset my 2Fa

they said you can reset it with your 2Fa backup code or verifying yourself by taking a photo from yourself holding these informations:  

1. Today's date;
2. Today's BTC price;
3. A handwritten text ""*2FA reset for the Blockchain.com Exchange"";*
4. Email Address registered to your Blockchain Exchange account;
5. Your full name, address and date of birth.

Since I didn't have my 2fa back up I was forced to verify myself.

In summary, I end up sending my information and verify myself but there was a problem, some of my information when signing up was fake because blockchain wasn't supporting my country 

but on January 13, 2021, they ended up accepting my verification and they answered me with this message :

https://preview.redd.it/gff0si0uln771.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b832555e07bbfd6b45dcd913b23a6516694681d3

 so they said the funds will be refunded, and I send them a BTC wallet address to refund my money

and this is what they answered 

https://preview.redd.it/gsqk9vdbmn771.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91141ea6d364809e29b2fa040cc03f2304467ee0

I asked them, when? but I kept getting the same message and they set my request to SOLVED

so after about 2 months I create a follow-up to my previous request and asked them to give me an estimated time but they set my request to solved with no answer

I created few more follow-up requests but the same thing was happening until I tried to do it once more after 2 months, but this time this is what they said :

https://preview.redd.it/nltk9w1ynn771.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4259f9dc04530b143e198bf3357fd13ed1d85f7b

I was so confused and I was like what does that have to do with my problem I don't know what they were talking about and at the same time I realized my blockchain exchange account is deleted cause when I was trying to sign in it tells me to sign up and an account with this email doesn't exist I tell the new support the whole story again but after about 5 months they still haven't answered me and my request is still open.

after all that and a few months later I create a follow-up to my first request again, first time I explain everything again but all they do was setting my request to SOLVED  with no answer did the same thing again after few months but all I get was a SOLVED request with no message and now its been almost 8 months and still haven't got even an answer.

hope they even hear me out or people in here help me."

1624838568,Bitcoin,"Do you think in the future most households will put more than 5% of their earnings into bitcoin?When you look at the US inflation, it is almost hard to believe. In 2020, your $1,000 is actually worth $1,040.12 in 2021 money due to the 4.99% inflation. This is calculated by BLS and uses the consumer price index. 

To put in a 20 year context, your $1,000 back in 2000 has the same buying power of $1,563.27 today. But if you left it in the bank and collected a tiny interest over time, your actual money has depreciated over the decades. For other countries like the UK, their inflation is actually worse. £1,000.00 in 2000 would be equivalent to £1,726.63 in 2021. 

Rather than having your fiat currency in the bank, wouldn't it make more sense just to store it in bitcoin? For people planning on retiring for the next 20 years, aren't you worried about the rapid inflation in your currency? Typically the US experiences a 2.5% inflation every year but with this year it has risen to 4.99%."

1624834781,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin and spiritual regression: an unexpected linkMore or less randomly, I stumbled upon some documentary about 'spiritual regression'.

This can be described as a way which - supposedly - allows you to access memories of your past life/lives (implying reincarnation).

I am scientifically minded but I also accept that there is so much we don't know about the very nature of ourselves and the universe in which we happen to live.

So, I was thinking: let's suppose for a moment that reincarnation -  or something similar - is real. What would that imply?

Being bitcoin what it is - an asset which you fully own by simply 'knowing' something (private-key / seed) - then bitcoin would also be the only asset that you can easily 'leave to yourself' in your next life/lives.

You would 'just' need to see/remember the seed (again), for example with the help of spiritual regression.

Thinking about other kind of assets, it would be extremely difficult to (re)acquire them in your next life, because it would be almost impossible to prove your 'property rights' on them (and everything would have been inherited by your 'old' relatives).

Bitcoin is different: knowing the seed is enough 'proof' (but this can work only if you didn't leave the seed to your relatives).

Well, that would be next-level holding!"

They are starting to crack down on the 111 unregistered crypto firms in the country. The head of FCA is biased though, he has referred bitcoin as ""tulip mania"" and has issued warnings that putting money into bitcoin is ""extremely volatile."" At this moment, companies that applied for registration before Dec 2020 will have a Temporary Registrations Regime license. 

They have cracked down on Binance and are moving towards banning other businesses/exchanges that do not comply with their regulations. In a lot of territories like Ontario, we are seeing authorities viewing bitcoin as a security. Securities require extensive review, registration and an insurance to protect customers."

[https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever](https://decrypt.co/37171/lost-bitcoin-3-7-million-bitcoin-are-probably-gone-forever)

If this is true, and BTC someday becomes the world's reserve currency, replacing the 200 trillion dollars of currency in circulation around the world, that would imply that the final value of one BTC could be as much as around 10 million dollars, nominally speaking, in today's money.

Which would make each sat worth about a dime.

And of course the shrinkage, while I'm sure it's slowed dramatically as BTC has increased in value, hasn't stopped altogether. And even after it arrives at its final destination, and even if that destination is 10 million usd, it won't stop even then. Even if BTC replaces all other currency, the deflation, although slowed, will never stop.

Those are kind of sobering thoughts. And that's also assuming that its evolution from this point forward is smooth. While I'm very optimistic about BTC's ultimate success, I think a big part of that success will be surviving yet another global financial crisis, which I believe will be far worse than the first one. I believe BTC could suffer horribly in the short term during such an event, but recover dramatically when hyperinflation of fiat currencies finally sets in. I could easily see a scenario in which a global financial crash brought BTC to its knees, and cause the world to think it had failed. In such an event, we could see key loss like never before, even worse than the development phase when people took few precautions to protect them.

So ultimately it's anyone's guess how much value a single BTC could have. But it would seem that 10 million in today's dollars is a good conservative estimate, in the event that it eventually became the universal reserve for the world.

I write this as a word of encouragement, but also as one of warning. Along with the standard advice of not investing more than you're willing to lose, I would add to that, if such a time comes when people think BTC is dead, that may be your signal to guard those keys more tightly than ever before. Even if it returns to .10 per BTC, you continue to protect that BTC as if it were worth 10 million, because if hyperinflation kicks in, it could literally go from .10 to 10 million dollars in only a few short months."

1624825145,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, daily hash rate, future energy consumption and the lightning networkDear knowledgable bitcoiners,  


I love simulation modelling, and I've been playing around with a model to get a better understanding of Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Basically, I used this scientific paper as a starting point: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212). I then added some small components to simulate historical energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, and compared my results to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ([https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)).   


Here are the historical simulation results (simulation starting at 9th of july 2016  and running in days):   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to early june 2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/hlr3gw6r7v771.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64103052c843370a0099c9145900c289e6706911)

I then started playing around a little. I ran a simulation going about 20 years ahead while assuming the following:  
\- Daily number of transactions will remain constant at 250 k per day  
\- Transaction fee per transaction remain constant at todays level (measured in BTC)  
\- The energy efficiency of mining hardware also stays constant at todays level  
\- The electricity prices stay constant at todays level  
\- The price of bitcoin increases 5% per year.   


This is what I got:   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to somewhere about june 2041](https://preview.redd.it/8xl8wpyf8v771.jpg?width=489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a3a518313080a8d9d31609e79687a433f20f89)

  
I then realized that the miners are mostly incentivized by the built-in subsidy right now. In fact, my model estimates that bitcoin miners would only consume about 15 TWH per year if it wasnt for the built-in subsidiy. Due to the halving events, the incentives for mining will go down over time following the next halving as long as the bitcoin price does not increase by more than 50% per 4-ish year period.  At least according to my model... 

Having realized that, I came to think about the lightning network. Someone told me that the lightning network will basically bundle a lot of transactions such that it becomes only one transaction on the network. This had me wondering, what will happen to the future hash rate if LN bundle a lot of transactions in one transaction, and the block rewards go down significantly? Won't it become much less profitable with mining? Will the network still be secure in a setting where the hash rate is very low?   


All the best,   
A curious mind"

1624823950,Bitcoin,"Am I 100% doing this Coldcard thing right?Upon receiving it, I updated and verified the firmware, and it has been 100% airgapped ever since. I use a 9v battery to power it, have not plugged it into a computer, and it hasn't had an SD card since the firmware update.

It's for long term storage and is to remain 100% airgapped. Bitcoin goes in and doesn't come back out again until time to buy moon lambo.

After updating the firmware, I generated test wallets by throwing dice, and verified them using the python script from their website. After being confident that it was faithfully encrypting the dice throws, I generated my actual seed, which I of course didn't verify, but backed up by engraving the 24 word seed on stainless steel.

I then sent a thousand in BTC to the first address listed in the address explorer on the device, after which I wiped the seed and restored it using the backup I had engraved, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes recording it. The restored wallet showed the same receive addresses in the address explorer.

I'm now sending small amounts to subsequent addresses in the address explorer, in order.

The only thing I haven't done is test sending BTC out of the wallet, since that would require breaking my airgap. Which leads to my main question.

Are there any possible mistakes, errors in firmware, etc. at this point that could still mean losing the BTC I send to this wallet? Or am I 100% good to go and have nothing to worry about?"

1624821829,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin critisismI look for criticism and I am pro bitcoin, I have to say its hard to
find proper arguments against bitcoin on this reddit. I see manly
negative news articles about some regulation and other news that seem
bad for btc. But no fundamental discussion. What I found so far are these:

1) Price is to volatile, or It has no guaranteed value and it's a bubble
2) It's not accepted yet and you can't pay in most shops
3) It faces harsh drawbacks from government/the people who do not want
to give away their power of printing money, so they will somehow stop it.

4) There are thousands of coins out there = inflation. I deem that not
to be true since every POW system that has a smaller hashrate that
bitcoin is theoretically ""hackable"" by the hashingpower provided by the
btc miners, plus compare the hashing power to any other network or
supercomputer in the world, do the math yourself, it's not that hard)


I myself find some aspects not good, like that it will - if it succeeds - change or party crash the economy. Like there is not so much incentive to spend the money or btc now when (in btc terms) there is almost no Inflation. (Which in my opinion would make a positive impact on the enviroment since people won't waste their money on useless and short-lived products)
The environmental standpoint of course, but all the energy goes directly into the cryptographic security and the immutability btc offers (not security in terms of $ - that's just determined by supply and demand) so it makes it more resilient to being hacked wich ich almost impossible.
It's just like an unbiased accounting system in my eyes. Though you have to compare it to the traditional banking system with all those buildings and ATMs running around the clock and whatever else the banking system needs.

I would love to hear some constructive criticism, for me personally it seems like a system that will (at what price however, probably going up) continue to exist."

I've also noticed that the cars in my area are very expensive, new vehicles are now priced at 27,000-39,000. These are new Kias, Hondas and Toyotas in San Francisco dealerships. Five years ago, prices for these same vehicles ranged from 18,000 to 26,000. 

The US dollar annual inflation rate is now 5%. I know that the US dollar is still better than other countries but the cost of living has risen and the wages haven't climbed very much. With bitcoin, I see my dollar's worth appreciating. I trust in bitcoin, despite its market volatility, its overall value seems to be climbing every year.

I stopped buying full price designer cloths and looked for deals, I stopped jumping into trendy fads, I stopped paying for cable tv and I upgraded my internet to stream tv instead.

I am guessing this will be a somewhat different post, and quite the long one as well. Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# Next, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge Røkke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company.

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now.

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro.

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good.

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it.

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well.

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

Researchers start by looking at the bitcoin network’s daily “hashrate”—i.e., how quickly computers on the network can perform calculations. Then they make some assumptions about the computer equipment most miners are using.1 Throw in an estimate of average electricity prices and the latest price for bitcoin, and you can get an accurate, if imprecise, estimate of electricity consumption. The most reputable such estimate comes from the University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, according to which the global bitcoin network currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of 23 coal-fired power plants, or close to what is consumed by the nation of Finland."

Eventhough I don't really know how it works or how to use it, I have the feeling that it will not improve the world or make it a better place.  I think I know what it is enough to judge it without needing to learn about it because the name sounds simple. 

It's a coin on the internet. 

Eventhough I will never pretend to know how physics, neuroscience or chemistry work, I know how bitcoin works without needing to learn about it.  Eventhough I have no experience with decentralized systems, cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, or money itself, I have enough experience with scams and empty promises to know that Bitcoin is a scam.  

I do think I am smarter than most people. Most people don't believe in Bitcoin. I , like 99% of the population, think Bitcoin is a scam and only morons would buy it. Because we are smart, we won't get scammed.  

We don't need Bitcoin because it is not backed by anything. My money is backed by a government. I can trust my government because all governments are trustworthy and never print out too much money that will devalue our currency. 

This is why house prices have been the same for the past 100 years, and are affordable for everyone. This is how my parents bought this house for us 50 years ago. Now if we sell it, we can make half a million dollars. This is thanks to the government. 

Bitcoin is backed by what? It's backed by nothing. There is no government, no bank, no institution or company behind it. It's just a bunch of computers. Computers are untrustworthy. You can't trust a computer. Computers crash. They malfunction. You can trust the government because people are more trustworthy and uncorruptable.

And don't even mention the fossil fuels used by Bitcoin itself. This is just ridiculous. I don't want to be part of that. I don't want to contribute to destroying the planet. I consider myself a person who cares and protects the planet that's why I only use electric cars and eat organic. 

Eventhough I understand poor people can't afford anything because their savings get devalued every year, I think their problems will be solved once they get a real job and work harder. Then they can retire in the house their parents bought them and contribute to our cause by getting their own electric cars.

Why do we even need to waste so much energy on Bitcoin when we have banks? Banks don't use up fossil fuels. 

I have the feeling that the Bitcoin community is just full of greedy people who only care about making money. In my opinion, and in the opinion of almost everyone I know, only greedy people would buy something like that.

Firstly, on the Bitcoin 1 day chart, we see a falling wedge pattern getting formed. As we know the falling wedge is a bullish pattern. Yesterday, we broke above the falling wedge and today we are treating the top line of the wedge as a support. If we can confirm it as a support, the target for Bitcoin will be approximately $40,000. But before reaching $40K, there are a lot of resistances. The first resistance is at the level of $35,000 which has been acting as a resistance for the past few days. If we break above the $35k, then the 20 day simple moving average which is at $35, 750 will act as a string resistance. If we cross above that, then the 50 day simple moving average which is at $38k approximately will be the next hurdle before reaching $40K. And once we reach $40K, the 200 day Simple moving average will be the strongest resistance.

Secondly, on the Bitcoin 4 hours chart, we see a double bottom pattern getting formed which is also a bullish pattern. The neck line for this pattern is close to $35,500 level. If we break above it, then our target could be $40,000. But, as mentioned earlier there are several resistances before we reach $40K.

Lastly, on the Bitcoin Monthly chart, we notice that the level of $30,112 is a very critical support and breaking below it can take Bitcoin price to about $20,000. So, its very important that we close this month above the aforementioned price."

Meanwhile, in five days the network’s mining difficulty change is approaching and it could see the difficulty drop over 20%.
Statistics show that bitcoin (BTC) miners are processing blocks a lot faster, as the hashrate has improved during the last 48 hours. On June 26, 2021, the network’s hashrate jumped back above the 100 EH/s zone.
The hashrate fell to 91 EH/s on June 23, 2021, following the crackdowns in China stemming from five Chinese provinces with the most recent being Sichuan. Between then and over the last three days, the hashrate has increased 9-13%The next mining difficulty drop is expected to happen in five days and at current processing power, it could drop around 20.57%. At the time of writing, the network’s mining difficulty is 19.93 trillion and the change could bring it to 15.83 trillion next week.
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is essentially the measurement of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. When Bitcoin’s hashrate is high, the difficulty will increase, and when the hashrate drops like it did after China’s crackdown, the mining difficulty will drop lower. Therefore making it easier and harder to mine BTC with every fluctuation. Bitcoin’s network difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks or roughly every two weeks.

The top five bitcoin (BTC) mining pools on June 26, 2021, include Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Poolin. Those five mining pools capture 62.83% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while the rest is processed by 11 known pools and a 7.49% portion of mystery hashrate.
The next difficulty change seems to be pointing toward the largest mining difficulty drop in 2021 thus far. The network did see the largest difficult rise in 2021, with an approximate 21.53% increase, at block height 683,424 on May 13."

1625012561,Bitcoin,"Never sell your Bitcoin?Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to see what the overall consensus was on selling Bitcoin. The well-known Bitcoin advocate Mr. Michael Saylor has already stated that you should never sell your Bitcoin and that you should hold onto it for life. He argues that when you sell you're Bitcoin you're taxed, but if you hold onto it you can borrow against the Bitcoin (tax-free) at a decent interest rate. Platforms such as Block Fi offer this type of service. 

What do you guys think about this? If I double my investment during this next bull run it would be tempting not to sell a little bit for liquidity purposes. I do love Bitcoin and the direction it's going so I plan on investing in this for the long term regardless of short-term price fluctuations. 

Thanks"

(https://www.census.gov/popclock/) 

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally..."

1625093167,Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and CanadaThere is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

1625092816,Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC/ETH, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and Canada.There is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Use this link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC/ETH  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

1625091611,Bitcoin,"1% a day strategy | Does it really work?Hello people of reddit! So I recently watched this video where this dude spoke of a 1% profit per day strategy using day trades where he had initially invested $20,000 and kept on making 1% each day and kept reinvesting the profits into the principle and repeated it till he made over $600,000 in the span of like 12-14 months. So once I made the math, if he had continued for over 2 years, he would've made $4+ Million which would've been insane. So, the question is, is this actually doable? If it is, would trades of such high volume be executed in one go? I'm relatively new to the crypto space so if this all sounds dumb, just don't mind lol

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I'm aware of BTC's lightning network, but hasn't that become a meme at this point? I own BTC, I want to see it succeed, I just don't understand BTC maximalism and why anyone would say it has more potential than ETH. Thank you."

I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

1625077332,Bitcoin,"Deflation: the real reason it's good for youtl;dr: No matter who you are, deflation can be good for you. But there are some misleading misconceptions.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!"

For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind. This brings a whole new era of financial sovereignty as we know it.

1625096434,Bitcoin,"How Much is BTC Worth? Easy Math, Alot of Research, and Some DebateThe US has 332,475,025 citizens
(https://www.census.gov/popclock/) 

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally..."

1625093167,Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and CanadaThere is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

So I recently watched this video where this dude spoke of a 1% profit per day strategy using day trades where he had initially invested $20,000 and kept on making 1% each day and kept reinvesting the profits into the principle and repeated it till he made over $600,000 in the span of like 12-14 months. So once I made the math, if he had continued for over 2 years, he would've made $4+ Million which would've been insane. So, the question is, is this actually doable? If it is, would trades of such high volume be executed in one go? I'm relatively new to the crypto space so if this all sounds dumb, just don't mind lol

I was talking to someone on Telegram and he couldn't answer all my questions, so he referred me here and said the community is very open and willing to help and answer questions, so here I go!

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I'm aware of BTC's lightning network, but hasn't that become a meme at this point? I own BTC, I want to see it succeed, I just don't understand BTC maximalism and why anyone would say it has more potential than ETH. Thank you."

I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!"

For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind. This brings a whole new era of financial sovereignty as we know it.

now several sources I've encountered state that anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork came into possession of bitcash  'as if from an airdrop' (quote).

now I may be wrong here but that does not sound like BTC holders at the time of the fork had to choose between keeping their BTC holding and receiving equivalent holding in bitcash. rather, it sounds like BTC holders at the time received bitcash holdings on top of their BTC holding at no addition cost. is that what happent? and if so, was it a one time thing which people had to apply for or can anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork still claim some bitcash?

1625171544,Bitcoin,"Due Diligence on BTC Trading Bot 

I started trading Bitcoin a month ago I came across a ""trading bot"" ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com)) that seemed to have promising results so I decided to give it a try. The results since then have been…remarkable. I'm not an employee, just a fan so here's my write up.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS A TRADING BOT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

Crypto markets are open all the time and don't close. AuthenticBot is a fully automated bot, that trades on your behalf 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. It was created by a couple of clever developers in Germany. They've been working on it for a year, and finally made it publicly available in Feb 2021.

AB uses a set of indicators to look for likely points of Bitcoin price reversals. It will determine trade bias, trade amount, entry point and exit point. It will then long/short BTC futures using small amounts and dollar cost average until the exit point is reached. The bot will never leverage more then 10% of your account, and most of the time only bets 1%.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT EXCHANGE DOES IT USE?

The bot uses the ByBit exchange that allows you to trade futures contracts on BTC. ByBit does NOT support all countries, and will filter out IP addresses coming those countries. For instance, the US is one of the handful of countries NOT supported, but most other countries (ex: Canada) are supported. Beyond an IP check, they don't check for anything else…**so some people will use VPNs to fund their bybit account.**

There's a lots of videos on what bybit is and how to trade on it, here are a couple:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/90d6vb7fvn871.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=047141e815bcbbab9944801c86040c0a65b22780

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mbihq5gvn871.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91543f3a258cc8bc9f9e637b2f330cbef8992fd

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

ARE MY FUNDS SAFE?

The first question is if the funds are safe from the bot owners? As an account owner, you would grant the bot API permissions to ONLY perform trades on your behalf. The bot would NOT have permissions to do withdrawals, only do trades.

The next question is are the funds safe on ByBit exchange? Any hot wallet is less safe then a cold wallet, and ByBit is likely no exception. ByBit is also not FDIC insured. So if you're accustomed to trading traditional securities on Etrade, this may not be for you. The bot needs access to your BTC to make trades with it, so having funds in a hot wallet is a risk if you want to trade BTC. There's lots of articles on ByBit exchange platform security, so I would recommend doing your own DD here. AB is definitely aimed for folks who are already trading crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, etc.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

SO…HOW HAS THE BOT PERFORMED?

When you setup the bot, they will create twitch stream where you can monitor your bots trades. The initial bot account ([https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44](https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44)) was created in Feb 2021 and seeded with 0.30393405 BTC ($10k USD at the time). As of today, it has 0.79744405 BTC ($26.2k USD)…for an increase of +162% BTC over 5 months!!

When I first looked at this, I thought it couldn't be true. So I looked at the trades since beginning of May 2021 when BTC was near 60k (it has crashed 40% in that time frame). Over that last 40 days, the bot has made 177 trades.

Keep in mind, 20% increase in BTC does NOT mean your account increased by 20% in USD. If BTC drops by an amount greater then 20% per month, a 20% increase in BTC likely means your account is close to break even. However if BTC can remain stable or increases, then your USD value will increase with the BTC growth.

As a day trader, I only make profits M-F. What I like about AuthenticBot is that it's trading for my 24/7. When I wake up, it's usually made a profit…sometimes small, sometimes big.

\- 165 trades were profitable (93%) vs 12 trades for losses (7%)

\- Average trade size was only 1.47% of the account

\- Average profit per trade was 0.00539 BTC (or $180 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average loss per trade was 0.0001183 (or $3.60 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average win:loss dollar ratio is almost 50:1.

\- **Average ROI over this 40d period was +0.69% BTC per day, or +20.7% per month (net of bot fees)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE?

AB owners charge a fee based on monthly profits, so if you make BTC then they make BTC. They charge 30% of the profits they earned on your behalf. Yes it's a chunk, but you're not paying anything out of pocket. If they only earn a little, you pay a little. If they earn you a lot, then you pay more. **However, if you don't make any profits for the month, then they don't you charge anything and it's FREE.** So if they break even or lose BTC, then they worked for free for a month and you pay nothing. It's a shared risk model. They also have a minimum balance to start a new account. When they first started it was $10k USD, it's now $20k USD.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I LEARN MORE?

They have a website ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/)) but they primarily engage with users and interested folks via a discord server and operate mostly on word of mouth. If you're interested and are ok with the account minimum balance/fees, contact them via [authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/) and they'll send you the discord link. You can join the discord server, ask questions and do your own due diligence. Again, costs absolutely nothing unless they make you a profit.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR

\- Fully automated bot that trades on your behalf 24/7, created by some guys in Germany

\- Bot trades on bybit exchange, buying/selling BTC futures contracts leveraging up to 10% of account

\- Over past 40 day period, it has averaged 0.69% per day or 20.7% per month (net profit)

\- Initial bot account seeded with $10k USD (in February 2021) with no additional funding now at $27k USD

\- Bot charges 30% of net profit - so you're only charged if it makes you a profit, $20k USD account minimum"

This noise level is only expected to increase, as Satis Group predicted; To be a successful investor in this space, it is best to just buy and hold what you believe in (see tip 4!) while ignoring all the noise around you.

2. Expect the unexpected

However, significant volatility does exist in cryptocurrency markets which cannot be ignored. Experienced cryptocurrency investors are accustomed to huge price swings that you often don’t find in traditional markets. By mentally preparing for these unfavorable, and occasionally terrifying, investment performances, the intelligent crypto investor will be able to act rationally instead of emotionally in times of unexpected price drops.

3. Avoid a bad trade or investment strategy

A common mistake for beginner cryptocurrency investors is joining what is known as a “pump and dump group” Certain social media communities or ‘gurus’ may even promise investment tips regarding a particular coin. You should avoid these types of places at all costs; when travelers go down these roads, they don’t often come back.

The problem is that since derivatives trading is a zero-sum game, there is always a winner, but more importantly a loser. Unless a solid trading or investment strategy is in place, heedlessly following such advice is the fast track to losing your money to modern-day snake oil salesmen.

4. Perform your due diligence

In this modern digital age, there is even wifi on the path to crypto investing enlightenment, hence there is no excuse to make an investment with little to no understanding of the underlying asset. Almost every single coin has easily accessible whitepapers online. And just like having maps in the car, the savvy traveler must be prepared.

From the heavily traded to the most niche, resources such as the All Crypto Whitepapers will help any individual brush up their knowledge on potential future investments. If it is impossible to tell how the coin operates and more importantly, makes money, then it would be wise to seek another investment opportunity. From the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) to the most niche altcoins, this site will have you covered.

5. Don’t place all your crypto-coins in one basket

Common investment wisdom prevails when it comes to cryptocurrency investment: diversification is key. Just as financial advisors recommend taking positions in multiple types of stocks and other investments, diversification is also essential for any healthy cryptocurrency portfolio.

You’ve done your research, so now seize the opportunity to invest in multiple coins. As one example, you can invest across different sectors which serve different use cases. Just like it’s always safer to travel as a group then as a single person when you’re in unfamiliar territory, establishing a diversified portfolio will help you along your path toward realizing potential future cryptocurrency gains.

6. Opt for an alternative personal email

Using a regular email account places an investor at an unnecessary risk of exposure for a data breach. To overcome this risk, it is recommended to create a unique account just for trading, especially with added two-factor authentication password security. No matter what, ensure that two-factor authentication is utilized for every service that offers it (for example both your email account and your exchange account should require two-factor authorization to access). Likewise, make sure to use a dedicated two-factor application (such as Google authenticator, or Authy) as opposed to using text messages for two-factor authorization (these are susceptible to social engineering hacks).

Additionally, when setting up your accounts, be sure to select a unique username and password that has no personally identifiable information that would-be hackers could trace back to you.

7. Understand the uses for both cold and hot wallets

Cryptocurrency can be stored via an offline “cold” wallet or an online “hot” wallet. Ease of access makes hot wallets a more desirable option for the beginner investor. However, as convenient as hot wallets are, they are susceptible to being hacked, whereas cold wallets are not able to be hacked (if prepared properly). Ideally, it’s best to store cryptocurrency you plan on saving for a long time in a cold wallet, and keep only a small amount that you might use on a daily basis in a hot wallet.

Additionally, one common mistake made by many new investors is mistaking exchanges for wallets. Although it might seem convenient keeping everything online at an exchange, a common mantra you might hear others chanting goes like ‘if you don’t own your keys, then you don’t own your bitcoin’. And when you keep your digital assets on exchanges, you don’t own the keys. This can become important when exchanges go down, get hacked. Take the time to research different wallet providers. There are lots of great options available today.

8. Remain careful around mobile wallets

Trading or storing large sums of any cryptocurrency via mobile phone is simply too great a risk. Mobile phones are more prone to being compromised electronically or physically. Although convenient, convenience should not surpass the security concerns that abound with executing trades or storing assets on mobile devices.

Hopefully, these eight tips will help give you solid footing on the road toward crypto-investing. Looking for more tips."

Bullish Year: 2013, 2017, 2021
Bearish Year: 2014, 2018

1st Take: Year 2013 and 2017 have only 3 months are red and 9 month are green. In 2021 we all ready saw 3 month red, now next 6 month can be green as per bull cycle.

2nd Take: In last 10 years, Whenever June close with red candle , July gave jump of of 18%-24%. So if July 2021 follow same , we will see target of near $42k as per average 20% growth.

3rd Take: In 2021,month jump is opposite of last 10 years trend. Examples are:
-Out of 10 times, March give 2 green and 8 red months in last 10 years. But in 2021 March gave 30% jump that was opposite of Trend.
-Same April and May month have bullish cycles in last 10 years, but both month was red in 2021. As per this August and September can be bullish month for bitcoin in 2021."

1625161324,Bitcoin,"Regarding Yesterday's Congressional Hearing with Coincenter's TestimonyI feel like the single missing part of regulatory talk in the united states on crypto is that no one understands that a unified clearing exchange for digital asset commodities will have to be built and the Token taxonomy act, and Digital Commodity act passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

CME can't work with blockchain. LedgerX and coinbase built the full financial stack. Traditional finance does not do this. Trad fi uses common clearing exchanges, prime brokers etc. It's economically unfeasible and untenable to expect every crypto service to build a full stack.  

&amp;#x200B;

 The obsession crypto people have with the SEC is misplaced. Bitcoin is a commodity. There has to be common backends that allow systemic risk monitoring and public data. That's how tradfi works, and US gov won't allow any other way. This is nonnegotiable for having a domestic market that institutions use. Right now all major institutions do significant derivative related things offshore. 

&amp;#x200B;

This can't and wont last based on what the DoJ wants. You may not like the direction things are going, but this is necessary to mainstream adoption. Crypto is overwhelmed with fraud as it is. It's a net detriment to long term adoption.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Re the mods-- You should not censor traders and legal researchers because you disagree with the government and hate futures. 

The mods here need to realize that being adversarial to regulatory talk is a zero sum affair. If you don't advocate for changes that allow modern institutions to participate we will not get mainstream hyperbitcoinization.  Shadow banks and hedgefunds trading on bitmex does not count, it \*is\* the problem. ***It's why congress is pissed.***

He wants to create a permanent resistance movement using blockchain to fix everything from file sharing to social media and banks. But thats futile. 

Blockchain only needs to be used in a small manner and with great precicion, namely to establish sound money. Because with sound money statism cannot exist and cause the problems it does today. I know it looks like facebook, banks, spotify etc. seem like culprits, but they are responding to incentives. Regulations are shaping their business models and reducing competition.

So instead of forming a permanent resistance movement by using blockchain for everything, just use it in such a way that the source of regulations is eleminated. Then we will have freedom, and then the world can begin to heal. Have a nice day."

I get that less BTC in circulation theoretically makes the remaining BTC more valuable.  But at some point might it erode to the point that there is so little left it would become too rare to become a meaningful currency/store of value.  At some point (if it isn't happening already) there will be more BTC lost than is mined every day.  At that point the math dictates that the supply of BTC will forever trend toward zero.

If BTC becomes adopted by billions of people, that's a lot of opportunity for private keys to be lost/forgotten/taken to the grave every day.

It seems like at some point it would become a problem that has to be addressed.

This post is just a discussions on a recent thought I had when assessing potential risks for future Bitcoin adoption. I am a very recent Bitcoiner so it is very possible that I'm making a basic logic mistake. Feel free to point that out.

As stated above, I only hold Bitcoin and I am constantly assessing the risks of Bitcoin failing or the Bitcoin adoption not going as I expect in the next 10 years.

As any Bitcoiner I don't believe any other cryptocurrency has any value because they trade-off fundamental values that only Bitcoin has been able to bring to the table (truly decentralised, censorship resistant, proof-of work, etc.). However, I am trying to assess the possibility of a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency seeing wider adotption or at least endorsement from big states (US, EU countries, etc), and here is my rationale:

**If Proof-of-Stake is worse at ensuring decentralisation because whoever has the biggest stakes has the biggest power, wouldn't that be attractive for governments who want to keep at leats a certain level of control on the circulating currencies?** For instance, If the US was to use adopt one cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, would they be more attracted to one that they could more easily control (like Ethereum 2.0)?

I am assuming that everything else works properly in Ethereum 2.0 in this case (both technically and economically), which is far from obvious and granted.

1625257573,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin MysteryI had this really strange occurence with bitcoin. I was looking on an archaic, 2002 type design website about cursed bitcoin addresses. Website was 17year.com but it has since been unregistered. The site had a 23 person queue, which seemed odd for such an old site. I also couldn't find any details on who had registered it or when. I had picked a random address before the shut down: (1EFUPp9gf1kWevhVKvchEdAXk3YQiBtnub, if you're brave enough to mess with it), and sent about 100 quid, 0.0041 Bitcoin, to the address. After about 12 hours, I get an email from an unrecognized address to my main email (not the email associated with my bitcoin address) saying the following:

Dear Mr. M2BT\_1328,

Thank you for your donation to our organization, and your support for our international pursuits is duly noted. We will use these funds to continue our cryptographic activities to bring online privacy to all.

\-17 Year Project.

It had this PGP ID: 7A35090F. What group is this? I know that the chances are low that this is real, and that it could be any old person on the internet trying to troll me, but how did they get my main email address, that I have not associated with any of my subscriptions, least of all bitcoin.

I did some further digging, and found this is a freewallet.io address. Clearly the account holder did not want to give any information to a registered company, so they opted for the opensource alternative. Can anyone do more checks and digging? I really want to know what's going on, and if this is a hoax. If I didn't make a mistake, the PGP is the same as Cicada 3301, and the signature at the end of the email supports that. I have read that in the US, Cicadas swarm every 17 years. Honestly that's as far as I can get since I work as a builder and am not tech savvy . Even most of this digging was done by my friend in Edinburgh, I'm just posting it. That is all."

1625256881,Bitcoin,"LN user experienceI tried playing around with LN a little bit and there is some stuff which doesn't seem that good:

If I want to follow the ""not your keys; not your coins""-style I would have to essentially run a node myself, because of the way the system with channels and so on is set up, right?

Do you see any way this could change in the future where you could allow for essentially trustless-SPV wallets without this requirement?

Breeze e.g. is non-custodial, but it works by essentially running a node on your phone?  
Now this would be good option, if the wallet itself wouldn't charge you fees on top of it?  
Phoenix is another wallet, but also charges you fees to use it (and requries a huge 10k sat inital deposit?).  
It's similar for muun IIRC.

Wallet of satoshi is of course custodial, but since it doesn't charge you fees it actually seems like the best option for a mobile wallet right now?

Do you guys think the UX for LN will improve in the future?  
And what do you think has to be done to change that?"

But then there are also transaction fees that senders have to pay to minders. At the moment, average transaction fee is USD 10.61 ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin\_average\_transaction\_fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee)). Also, at present, each block contains an average of 2,420 transactions. In total, the fees paid by all senders inside the block would be USD 10.61 x 2,420 =USD 25,676.2

So the total comp that a miner (or mining pool) who successfully ads a new block would be: USD 207,500 + USD 25,676.2 = **USD 233,176.2**

**Is the above calculation correct?** Will be very grateful for any comments on this."

1625251472,Bitcoin,"Awesome method to secure your seed phrase.Hi folks. We know in crypto world, private key gives anyone the full authority to use the funds. So securing your seed phrase is of utmost importance. Here i suggest a very clean and a secure method to store your seed phrase(which in turn generates your private keys).

1. We need a MacOS computer. Open the Keychain Access program(it is buid-in app on every mac).
2. Click the File menu and choose NEW KEYCHAIN to create a new keychain(it is a file basically). Give it name which will make this file easily recognisable to use even after many years(eg- important file OR bitcoin wallet seed phrase keychain). Create a very very strong password for it consisting of numbers alphabets &amp; special characters.
3. On the upper left corner of the Keychain Access program, you will see your newly created Keychain added to the list of default existing kekychains. Select the newly created keychain. Then go to File menu and choose NEW SECURE NOTE. This will create a secure note item inside this keychain. Give the note a suitable name(eg- my first bitcoin wallet details ETC).
4. Write down the seed phrase in this note. So now, your seed phrase sits in a secure note, which intern in sitting inside a special keychain file which a very strong password.
5. Now, from your Finder, reach your newly created keychain file(it will a .keychain file) and transfer it to a usb drive. Once you have the keychain file on a usb drive, enter the keychain access app and right click your keychain file(in the right upper corner of the app) and select DELETE FILE AND THE REFERENCE. This will delete that keychain file from your mac and it will also dissappear from the keychain access app. So if someone gets to your mac, opens keychain access, he will see only your default keychains. Problem of storing seed phrase in a secure note in the default keychains is that the password for it is the same as your macs logins password(which is mostly a simple password for daily use ease purpose).
6. The vey strong password that you created in step 4, you save it in a secure note in your default keychain. 
7. So if thief gets to your mac, reaches your keychain access and gets your very secure password, he will not get the secure keychain file(which you will be storing in a secure place away from your mac). You can make multiple copies of the secure keychain file and store it in multiple usb drives and store them at multiple places. As no one can open the file without the very secure password, just getting the file will not be useful for the thief. 
8. On a later date, if you feel that your very secure password is compromised somehow, you can open your secure keychain file from the usb drive in other secure imac and change its password.
9. This way, using the keychain access app of macos, we can secure our seed phrase.
10. Please leave your comment if you feel this helpful OR if you find any flaws in this method. Thank you."

1625348204,Bitcoin,"Concerns about privacy. Can we have a little discussion?Recently, i have been thinking about privacy and Bitcoin.

I know that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, as you can track every adress. It is somehow private in a way that nobody know who own which adress. Atleast until you glue your name to some of them.

If you buy through KYC service with fiat like coinbase or Binance, they have this one line that says ""date, amount, name, verification of ID, adress where it went"" and from this time they can track everything you did with your money.

Arent you afraid of your government? Until US passed executive order on gold confiscation, nobody thought that could happen.

Dont you think that they can do the same with bitcoin? They know everything they need and even if you dont have it anymore, you have mark on your skin... only way how to prevent them is buying though non-kyc or old P2P with cash.

There are other reasons. Tracking, social problems because they can prove you re ""dirty energy waster and you are probably molesting kids"", there might be persecutions and basically have to obey every law of taxation and persecution, because they KNOW you boght coin.

Arent you concerned about some of those scenarios? 

They might seem like the worst one, but every day we are losing our rights and this is not different. It might be much faster in future, if governments see their power vanishing with fiat currencies value and trust. 

What can i do to prevent that except buying bitcoins P2P with services like Bisq or face-to-face?"

They all have decent processors. I'll narrow this down. The beelink t4 has an atom x5 processor, 4gbs or ram, and 64gb eMMC, new for 120-140$ Admittedly likely a slow unit so here's another: intel NUC5 with and I3 dualcore 4 thread processor, 8gb or ram, 128gb ssd: used for 100-140$ 
 There's all combinations of used and new units that seem to be right up there in capability with the PI4 series. And the only thing I can figure out that the Raspberry's have over the mini pc is the power consumption and maybe a little bit of fan noise.  Is there something I'm missing"

Buy a mining device, the more hash rate the more money you'll gonna make. Remember, you won't need any fans, just a good passive heat radiator, bigger surface is better.

2. Step:

Build a satellite and mount your mining device on that baby. In case of power, just stick a nuclear battery on it.

3. Step:

Launch that satellite into the space and let it fly with the highest possible speed into the Orbit of an black hole. 


Now you're done. You have the worldwide fastest minding machine! Because of the rising speed of your satellite, wich is slowly getting sucked into the black hole while it's spinning on the Orbit, relatively the time will slow down for that satellite.

I am looking for initial interest, and I will do the leg work.

So I was just informed of how scary it is for pediatric cancer survivors to exist in times of covid. Would your exchange sponsor help us donate crypto to an accredited charity to help improve the quality of life of kids with terminal diseases and compromised immune systems?

I was thinking of bringing video games especially VR to hospitals to give an escape.

I think this will help adoption and be amazing PR for crypto as we know, all while doing something awesome in scary times.

The idea is simple:

We get exchanges to allow users to dust their accounts of tiny odd crypto and donate it to a cause.

(e.g. we get the charity to set up a wallet(s), and the crypto goes directly to them.)

I have had preliminary very early conversations with folks at Childrens Miracle Network, Cals Angels and Lurie's Childrens. They are skeptical of crypto as a whole, but like the idea if it was all on the up and up.

I am trying to drum up initial interest to make it a reality"

Bitcoin had a solid start to 2021, hitting an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April. But the digital coin closed out the first half of the year down about 47% from its record — and a number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
While proponents appear to be holding onto bitcoin for now, other investors are wary about wild volatility in the market and what it means for their portfolios. With that in mind, here are five of the biggest risks facing the cryptocurrency as we enter the second half of the year.
Regulation
One of the biggest risks for bitcoin right now is regulation.

In recent weeks, China has clamped down on its cryptocurrency industry, shuttering energy-intensive crypto mining operations and ordering major banks and payment firms like Alipay not to do business with crypto companies.

Last week, the global crypto crackdown spread to the U.K., where regulators banned leading digital currency exchange Binance from undertaking regulated activities.

Simon Yu, co-founder and CEO of crypto cashback start-up StormX, told CNBC that China’s moves should be viewed as a “positive” thing for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ether as it will lead to more decentralization. However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

“As a country, the U.S. has too many departments regulating it from different angles — is crypto a security? A commodity? A property?” Yu said. “As of now, the U.S. hasn’t figured out how to properly regulate the industry, which oftentimes leads to decisions that are difficult for crypto to operate.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials have recently warned about the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions.

Last year, former President Donald Trump’s administration proposed an anti-money laundering rule that would require people who hold their crypto in a private digital wallet to undergo identity checks if they make transactions of $3,000 or more.
“We’ve long warned that shifting investor sentiment or regulatory crackdowns could pop bubble-like crypto markets,” UBS wrote in a note this week.

Volatility
Another big risk is persistent, extreme swings in the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Bitcoin rallied to an all-time record of around $64,829 in April this year, on the day of crypto exchange Coinbase’s blockbuster debut. It then tumbled as low as $28,911 in June, briefly sliding below $30,000 and turning negative for the year. It’s since risen back above $34,000.
Bitcoin bulls see it as a kind of “digital gold” — an asset uncorrelated to the wider marker that could provide sizable returns in times of economic turbulence. But while volatility can be good when the price of an asset is going up, it goes both ways.

While you would have doubled your money if you bought bitcoin in January and cashed out in April, today those year-to-date returns would be 18%. Still, that’s above the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is up 16% since the start of the year. And over the last 12 months, bitcoin has more than tripled in price.
“Limited, highly inelastic supply on single cryptos can exacerbate volatility,” says UBS. “Limited real world use and extraordinary price volatility also indicate many buyers are seeking speculative gains.”

Meanwhile, the trend of traders who have made highly-leveraged bets on bitcoin getting flushed out of the market has led to intense price fluctuations this year.

While continuous volatility could put off some investors, Ross Middleton, chief financial officer of decentralized finance platform DeversiFi, said that volatility in itself isn’t a barrier to institutional adoption.
Volatility “can actually be a significant draw as the potential for large price movements means that funds can make significant profits with a relatively small allocation compared to the size of their overall portfolio,” he told CNBC.

“The longer that Bitcoin moves sidewards in the $30-$40k range,” Middleton added, “the greater the perceived ‘base-building’ and the sooner that new capital will flow into both the asset and the wider crypto market.”
Environmental concerns
Questions surrounding bitcoin’s impact on the environment could be another big headwind for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin mining equipment requires lots of electricity to run, and bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen considerably over the years in tandem with its price.

While bitcoin’s critics have long warned of its huge carbon footprint, Tesla CEO Elon Musk brought the issue back to the fore this year."
1625339764,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin mining is now easier and more profitable as algorithm adjusts after China crackdownMore than 54% of bitcoin’s hashrate, which is the collective computing power of miners worldwide, has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
The bitcoin code has re-calibrated to make it 28% less difficult to mine.
Miners who are still plugged into the network stand to make greater profits while most of the network’s miners remains offline.
It just became a whole lot easier and much more profitable to mine for bitcoin.

The world has known for months that more than half the world’s bitcoin miners would be going dark as China cracked down on mining. Now that it’s happened, the bitcoin algorithm has adjusted accordingly to make sure miner productivity doesn’t continue to fall off a cliff. 

That adjustment – which took effect early Saturday morning – also means that way more cash is going to the bitcoin miners who remain online.

“This will be a revenue party for miners,” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi.

“They suddenly own a meaningfully larger piece of the pie, meaning they earn more bitcoin every day.”
Mining made easier
A bitcoin miner runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. 

China had long been the epicenter of bitcoin miners, with past estimates indicating that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened there, but a government-led crackdown has effectively banished the country’s crypto miners. 

″For the first time in the bitcoin network’s history, we have a complete shutdown of mining in a targeted geographic region that affected more than 50% of the network,” said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. 
More than 50% of the hashrate – the collective computing power of miners worldwide – has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
Fewer people mining means that fewer blocks are solved each day. Typically, it takes about 10 minutes to complete a block, but Feinstein told CNBC the bitcoin network has slowed down to 14- to 19-minute block times.

This is precisely why bitcoin re-calibrates every 2016 blocks, or about every two weeks, resetting how tough it is for miners to mine. On Saturday, the bitcoin code automatically made it about 28% less difficult to mine – a historically unprecedented drop for the network – thereby restoring block times back to the optimal 10-minute window. 
The bitcoin algorithm is programmed to handle an increase or decrease in mining machines, according to Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry. “It is a self-regulating market that does not require any outside committee to determine what to do. This is a very powerful concept,” he said.
Fewer competitors and less difficulty means that any miner with a machine plugged in is going to see a significant increase in profitability and more predictable revenue.

“All bitcoin miners share in the same economics and are mining on the same network, so miners both public and private will see the uplift in revenue,” said Kevin Zhang, former Chief Mining Officer at Greenridge Generation, the first major U.S. power plant to begin mining behind-the-meter at a large scale. 

Assuming fixed power costs, Zhang estimates revenues of $29 per day for those using the latest-generation Bitmain miner, versus $22 per day prior to the change. Longer-term, although miner income can fluctuate with the price of the coin, Zhang also noted that mining revenues have dropped only 17% from the bitcoin price peak in April, whereas the coin’s price has dropped about 50%.
“We are expecting a period of much higher mining profitability for Compass Mining clients,” said Whit Gibbs, CEO and founder of Compass, a bitcoin mining service provider. “We expect miners to be approximately 35% more profitable.”

Blockcap’s Feinstein agrees. “We are expecting a revenue and profit increase for the foreseeable future.  This was an unexpected gift to the network, not just on revenues but on decentralization and sustainable energy metrics.”

Although the difficulty drop benefits all miners, those using new-generation equipment stand to benefit the most.

Feinstein tells CNBC that most of the gear in China that was turned off was old-generation equipment, which is inefficient and runs on much smaller profit margins.  
Six-month surge
It is hard to predict how long the hashrate deficit will last. Barbour said that it is totally possible that Beijing could simply reverse their policy, and this could only be a short-term interruption. 

If not, most mining crypto experts agree that it will take anywhere from six to 15 months for all of that idle and displaced mining hardware to migrate. “It’s going to take a long time for the surplus to find a home,” said Barbour. 

Gibbs thinks miners should see heightened revenue for at least the rest of 2021.

“Every day the Chinese miners are searching globally for places to turn their machines back on. There is very limited space at the moment,” said Colyer.
Part of the problem, according to Feinstein, is that even before China cut off mining, there was already a lack of infrastructure to house the new-generation miners being deployed monthly by Beijing-based manufacturer Bitmain.

Now that the market is flooded with an over-supply of used mining rigs, it is tough to say how fast countries will be able to absorb the influx of gear. 

“Some mining companies have had everything built and were just waiting for these ASICs to plug in, which would only take a couple days,” explained Arvanaghi.

“Others may need to build containers, extend warehouses, or increase their power capacity. We won’t see the hashrate reach what it used to be overnight, but we’ll see it tick back up over the next few months,” he continued.
Of all the possible destinations for this equipment, the U.S. appears to be especially well-positioned to absorb this stray hashrate. CNBC is told that major U.S. mining operators are already signing deals to patriate some of these homeless Bitmain miners. 

U.S. bitcoin mining is booming, and has venture capital flowing to it, so they are poised to take advantage of the miner migration, Arvanaghi told CNBC. 

“Many U.S. bitcoin miners that were funded when bitcoin’s price started rising in November and December of 2020 means that they were already building out their power capacity when the China mining ban took hold,” he said. “It’s great timing.”

But Barbour believes that much smaller players in the residential U.S. also stand a chance at capturing these excess miners. 

“I think this is a signal that in the future, bitcoin mining will be more distributed by necessity,” said Barbour. “Less mega-mines like the 100+ megawatt ones we see in Texas and more small mines on small commercial and eventually residential spaces. It’s much harder for a politician to shut down a mine in someone’s garage.”"
1625339500,Bitcoin,"Here’s what cryptocurrencies will look like in 50 years according to expertsWe may not know what stocks in the S&amp;P 500 will do next month, or in two years, but over the decades, we have a pretty good hunch that they’ll go up. Most of us also know what a stock is, and that definition hasn’t changed in centuries.

None of that is true, of course, with cryptocurrencies. Some predict the coins will forever change how we understand and interact with money and others warn of a dangerous bubble.

But whatever a person forecasts for cryptocurrencies, it’s getting harder to imagine a future without them.
CNBC asked experts from a variety of fields to describe their vision for the currencies 50 years from now. Their answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.

• Ivory Johnson, certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management

“Cryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations. With respect to bitcoin, 50 years is a long time and bitcoin could either become the world reserve currency or the next AOL that made a lot of people wealthy until it was unseated by better technology.”
“Way before 2071, the dollar will have more in common with a crypto than with silver or gold, so there is no need to doubt the longevity of encrypted algorithms as stores of value and media of exchange. All money is a form of encryption. It’s been that way from the start, and as our lives converge ever more closely with the digital universe, the drive to invest in tokens will only accelerate. Ironically, that impulse will connect us to primitive instincts, and do its part to keep us human.”
“Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have proven themselves useful for money movement and speculation, and they’re unlikely to go away. But where and how we’ll generate the energy to meet the demand of a growing crypto market is worth considering, as well as whether state-actors who view it as a competitor to fiat power will make it even more of a black-market commodity.”
 Dragan Boscovic, founder and director of the Blockchain Research Lab at Arizona State University

“Central bank authorities are busy developing regulations on cryptocurrency. They recognize that digital currencies are native to the digital economy and, as such, are on their way to becoming mainstream in the next 10 years.”"

1622936353,Bitcoin,"I'm from El Salvador and I'm here to clarify some things about the BTC adoption recently announced.Hello, I'm from El Salvador so I'd like to give you all some information that might help you clarify things. I posted this in another thread and made some slight edits. 

First some info of the current zeitgeist in El Salvador: 

The president's party, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas), was formed in 2018-2019 as a new alternative to the old bipartisan, marxist-left (FMLN) and ultranationalist right (ARENA) system that had controlled the government since the end of the Civil War in 1992. He won the presidential elections in 2019 with 52% of the vote (overwhelming majority) and just recently won the legislative elections in 2021 by a landslide (73% of the vote). That means that his party controls the Congress with 2/3 of the legislators, which are enought to pass any bill that they want, and in fact that's what they've been doing. 

His party is made up of mostly young professionals tired of the corrupt system that has kept the country poor and underdeveloped for the past 30 years. In just their first day in office they fired the Attorney General (who had been protecting other corrupt politicians) and 5 other magistrates, accused of being bought by the oligarchy to protect their economic interests. In just a month, the new Congress has approved unprecedented financing for education and infrastructure and has passed bills that make sure that the predatory economic elites that used to buy politicians in the past are kept in check. Many big infraestructure projects are expected to be approved by Congress soon, including the construction of a high-speed railway and a new international airport.

One of the biggest projects that the government is building is called Surf City, which is basically road, electricity and communications infrastructure along the coastline to help small businesses. In fact, for this very reason, the ISA decided to hold the World Surfing Games (which are happening until tomorrow) to qualify for the Tokyo 2021 Olympics in El Salvador. Bitcoin is already used by small businesses in this area, especially in El Zonte, which is one of the more popular beaches that gets a lot of international tourists.

I know most people used to have the notion that El Salvador was a dumpster fire, because we were. However, the country is going through huge change. Just yesterday the ex-mayor of San Salvador (the capital) was captured by the police and is awaiting trial for corruption and gang financing and also the ex-first lady was sentenced to 10 years in prison for money laundering. El Salvador is no longer on the top 10 list of most violents countries in the world (the muder rate used to be 12-15 homicides daily and has decreased to nearly 3-4 daily since Bukele took office) and our economy is expected to grow steadily too. 

Bukele (39 years old) is extremely popular, with an approval rating of over 90% during his second year in office. Mostly due to this forward thinking. You can see this with the data related to the pandemic. El Salvador is the Central American country with the lowest mortality rate (due to a massive revamp of our healthcare system), the lowest number of COVID-19 cases and the fastest rate of vaccine applications, having just surpassed the 2 million mark. The government also just launched a project to give laptops to 100% of the students of the public school system. The country still has massive challenges to overcome but I'm confident we are on a very good path.

The adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender is HUGE news for this country. I assure you that Congress will pass this bill. I couldn't give you an exact date, but the economics commission will probably receive all the papers this week. 

I'll try to answer any questions that you guys might have.

1623015032,Bitcoin,"Thoughts on El Salvador adopting BitcoinEl Savador is looking to become the [first country](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57373058) in the world to switch to Bitcoin as a currency. 

There is some sound logic in this move. The country's currency has been pegged to the USD for the last [20 years](https://ticotimes.net/2021/01/04/el-salvador-marks-20-years-of-dollarization-with-weak-economic-impulse) and 23% of its GDP is [remittances](https://apnews.com/article/san-salvador-coronavirus-pandemic-el-salvador-1623416c0ddc7aa238911f8a422b6c8b) from abroad and around 10% of that money ends up in the hands of money transmission services. 

Switching to Bitcoin allows for a nearly 10% increase in GDP by simply skipping the overhead involved in the legacy money transfer system. 

It also switches the country to a monetary system with a predictable supply that is outside the control of any political organization.

Jack Mallers is a young kid who [enabled this](https://www.coindesk.com/strike-launches-bitcoin-lightning-payment-app-in-el-salvador-full-eu-support-is-next) in El Salvador.

This sounds like a good thing for Bitcoin. There will be increased demand for it as people move some of their money into BTC for remittance to El Salvador. From there on, that money can stay in BTC as it moves through the El Salvadoran economy. 

Some of those who are compelled to buy BTC for remittance might also find it useful as a means of some of their savings.

Dubbed the Daymak Spiritus, the car will be the first car in history with mining hardware and cryptocurrency technology programmed into the user interface.

The car, being electric and coming equipped with solar charging capabilities, boasts it is emissions-free, both for driving and cryptocurrency mining, putting the Tesla Bitcoin objection problem to rest.

“The Spiritus car is for those who want more in life, and we are committed to putting our customers ahead of the curve. We envision a future where your highway tolls, your parking, and your drive-thru order will be paid directly on the fly with crypto. Your online bills and your banking can be handled through the same software platform paid in crypto. And whereas most vehicles are depreciating while they sit in your garage, the Nebula Miner will make you money while your Spiritus is parked. The potential applications are limitless,” stated Aldo Baiocchi, President of Daymak.
“It is not just about building LEVs. We have positioned our Daymak Avvenire series as the LEVs of tomorrow, and tomorrow’s vehicles will feature an array of technology systems seamlessly integrated for the convenience of the driver. Daymak has been a champion for disruptive technologies since its inception, and the current crypto movement is a clear indication that by the 2023 Spiritus release date, we will be in the midst of the blockchain revolution. Everyone will be paying with crypto by then, and we are building these cars with that in mind,” added Baiocchi.

“Daymak Spiritus is more than a car.”"

1623013923,Bitcoin,"Jack Dorsey Unveils Square’s New Plans For A Bitcoin Hardware WalletToday, Jack Dorsey took to his Twitter feed to announce financial services company Square may be adding a hardware wallet for Bitcoin. Dorsey claims that if the project moves forward, the entire design and development will be open source and in collaboration with the crypto community.
Square is considering making a hardware wallet for #bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.
The Twitter thread explains that while exchanges have the best intentions for their clients, they cannot give them full control over their crypto. So bitcoin exchange balances are really not much more than IOUs when conditions are sufficiently hazardous.

Jack’s plan is to develop the idea of “assisted custody”, where management of crypto assets would lie somewhere between the current best practice of self-custody (where the user maintains 100% control and bears 100% of the risk) and exchange/managed custody (where custody is controlled by a third party).
Jack closed by saying he and his team would be evaluating feedback and that if the project were to move forward that he would be setting up dedicated social channels for it."

1623013713,Bitcoin,"1 Trillion Leaves Cryptocurrency Market Cap In Just One WeekThe cryptocurrency market cap is down approximately 1 Trillion dollars from its all-time high of 2.5 Trillion on May 12, just one week ago, a price depreciation of nearly 40%.
The sharp declines come on the heels of Elon Musk sending several critical tweets regarding Bitcoin energy usage and a false but widely circulated claim that China had banned financial institutions from servicing bitcoin-based businesses.

Taking a month’s view, Bitcoin dropped nearly 50% from an ATH of $64,000 on April 14 down to a low of $32,000 earlier today.

Ethereum briefly lost over 50% of its value, dropping from $4,300 on May 12 to $2,092 today before bouncing back to its current price of $2,660.
But will the carnage stop?

CNBC’s ‘Chartmaster’ Carter Worth envisions Bitcoin hitting a $29K low:

Cornerstone Macro’s Carter Worth appeared on CNBC this week and stressed that he thinks the current price is a top support region. Worth, who is also called the ‘Chartmaster’ sees BTC dropping 55% from the crypto asset’s high. 

I think we’re in support— it’s fighting, but my hunch is it goes lower.

Worth is not alone in his thoughts on the new Bitcoin price range.  Delta Exchange’s CEO Pankaj Balani thinks Bitcoin will stabilize in the $35K to $38K price range.

“Despite a sharp correction and BTC price trading in the support zone of $42,000-$44,000, we don’t think bitcoin has found a floor yet,” Balani said.

And Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote in Gland, Switzerland, said, “The next important support level stands near $37,000, then the $30,000 mark. There is a chance that we see a pullback to these levels and even below, at least in the short run.”"

That being said, during my temp ban, i head off into other subreddits and the hate that bitcoin get is INCREDIBLE.

There's one, in particular that carries the name bitcoin but is traditionally called by its shortened version of BTC and the shit that goes on over there is mind Blowing.

  
They pretty much hate on bitcoin every chance they get.

And i mean EVERY chance they get.  


Sometimes it really feels like jealousy.

Even in the ""Ranked Number 2"" forum, you get hate....all the way down to REAL sh1tcoins.

Its almost like an obsession.

I guess im asking, what is up with all of the hate?  
They can buy Bitcoin just like i can...so whats the deal? 

They cant get a whole one?

Who cares?  


Do they think Bitcoin is somehow going to disappear because they whine about it on their subreddit?

Its still the best performing asset of the last decade :

Did they seize BTC whenever the known wallets tried to move it from their wallet to another and basically highjack the transaction before it could be written into the blockchain?

1623198771,Bitcoin,"best trading platformThis is the best trading [platform](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419).
There are certainly many ways to profit in the online world, and each method has its own strategy.

 That is why one of the methods that I am going to show you today is so effective that you cannot find similar methods in the online world.

Which is how to invest your money and trading to earn more than $150 so I decided to bring you an amazing place called Antares. The site is very popular in the world and offers good service.

The site offers many different ways because it is a very big treasure to get a trading robot through the site. You can also invest your money on the site and get good money from the site.
What is [Antares](https://antares.trade/personal/?signup=MA403045419)?
Antares is a platform for investing in the digital market and companies that use the recommendation system model.
Profit from Antares depends on two ways:

First method:

  Paid After you purchase the package, some investors manipulate the invested money to make a daily profit for you, and after the package period expires, you will get the full benefit, usually three times. of the amount paid in advance. The platform feature is nothing but a team building system. Second method:

The site is network marketing if you invite people to nominate the platform you use the earnings on the platform if those people are owned by other people after you nominate you also get income from their deposits etc.
This is just an example of the site plans, you can invest in this site for $100, for 200 days you will get 5 percent return every day. This is a very good thing because the company invests and trades heavily and has good plans to distribute the funds among the investors. You can also find much less than that which is highly dependent on the larger programs. You can invest in a site of $50 for 280 days, and you have a good profit rate of $146 per day. That's cool, say just fifty bucks put it on the site and forget it, there's more software on the site.

Just choose the type of investment you want, and you can make money.
To see how much you get in 284 days or less, simply put the required amount in the $100 box and scroll down. You will find that the net amount is 298 which is a good thing, that is, you are simply waiting for your profits from the site at the end of the specified time"

1623197366,Bitcoin,"Is this how inflation works or am I just a crazy bitcoiner?
The fed prints money
The fed lends the money to the banks for a fee
Banks have shareholders who get paid in dividends
Banks lend that money out to customers for a fee
Customers buy things with that money
When they spend that money they have to buy from a business that uses a bank. If they do not eventually someone else will. 
That business pays a fee. 
That business adds the cost of the fees the bank charges in to its prices. 
So the customer is paying for the businesses bank account. 
The fed also buys assets like mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds. 
The bank charges the Fed a fee. Even if they did it for free the fee would be charged to the other customers.
The bank takes those fees to pay it’s costs of operation and debts to the federal reserve. 
Let’s not forget the bonuses!
Whatever is left over goes to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
Politicians are shareholders in the banks. 
Politicians voted to print more money to get everyone spending money. So the fed had to print more money and lend it out charging EVEN more fees causing prices to go up which means the people have to pay more! The more we spend the more fees get collected, the more the banks can afford to pay their shareholders and the more their earnings/share goes up. 

Now you have money you want to “save.” You give it to the bank. Because of fractional reserve banking they get to spend 90% of your money. The more they spend, the more fees they collect, the more dividends their shareholders get. When the pandemic hit and they started printing money they told the banks they could spend 100% of your money however they wanted. So EVEN MORE SPENDING, EVEN MORE FEES, EVEN MORE DIVIDENDS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. Don’t forget a lot of politicians are invested in banks! Either directly or indirectly through ETFs and/or hedge funds or other means. 

Politicians vote to lend money or just give money to other countries. 
They lend them dollars. 
You need to use the same bank technology to spend those dollars in other countries. 
The bank gets a fee. Those dollars eventually end up with the bank and in their shareholders pockets in the form of dividends and earnings/share. Remember politicians are shareholders in banks! 

Now when a bank lends out money they charge a fee because of “risk.” 
Unless I’m wrong they take on 0 risk because if you have it in your bank account they still get to use it to spend and collect more fees. If you spend it they collect a fee. And who you spent it with will spend it for a fee or put it on his bank account and the cycle continues. 
And all those fees go in to share holders pockets. Politicians are shareholders in the banks 


Bitcoin eliminates the federal reserve and the need for banks. Less fees, cheaper prices, less politicians getting rich by passing laws

1623194185,Bitcoin,"The bitcoin money supply is not fixed, and even if it was, this isn't an good thingAbandon the ""fixed money supply"" dogma already. I can give you three basic reasons:

1) The money supply is the money base times the money multiplier. A fixed money base doesn't imply a fixed money supply.

2) The quantity theory of money, which says that MV = PY, where M is money, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level and Y is the quantity of real goods. A fixed M doesn't imply a fixed P.

3) Deflation is worse than inflation. Deflation causes recession or hyperinflation. Bitcoin is at increased risk of deflation.

1623193970,Bitcoin,"Using 401k to purchase CryptoHello everyone. First time poster here.

The purpose of this post is to receive constructive criticism as well as important feedback regarding my current action plan.

For the longest time I've been contemplating on creating a Self Directed IRA/LLC to be able to have more control over my 401k portfolio. I'm 27 and have built a nice nest egg in my 401k throughout my career at my past employer.

For those not familiar with the topic of SDIRA (Self Directed IRA/LLC), to make a long story short it allows you to roll over your 401k account into an IRA that owns an LLC (that you can manage) without having to pay a 10% penalty for not meeting the age requirement of 59 1/2.

This type of account also give you the ability to invest in crypto/real estate/common stock/precious metals etc.

After careful consideration and research for some time now I've made up my mind and began the process.

Logically since this investment route allows me to ""drive the bus"" with my retirement money, this option is a lot riskier than following the traditional 401k route and for that reason I will only roll over 50-60% of my current balance leaving the rest to grow the traditional way.

Another thought I've come across is that one of the most important factors for investors is ""time"" and with me being 27 I figured I can afford a calculated loss if this SDIRA idea did not workout and still save for a good retirement.

As far as investing within my SDIRA I'm thinking a safe route would be to dollar cost average into crypto/stocks, another thought I came across was perhaps staking to generate passive income but I'm not very knowledgeable on the topic currently.

If you've read this far thank you, I would appreciate any feedback regarding this information."

I sincerely doubt that they are going to just talk about outright banning cryptocurrency, rather they just want to heavily regulate all global crypto exchanges/vendors and make them report all large transactions to prevent bad actors from exchanging crypto and so they can recover illegaly obtained bitcoin.

This is bad news for criminals that want to get paid in bitcoin, but there will always be ways that they can circumvent this with most probably opting to use a privacy coins instead.

Why would they ban bitcoin when they thing they can control it and tax the fuck out of it. the worst think that could possibly come from this is some retroactive crypto tax.

This ""heavy regulation"" they've been talking about will just make institutions more comfortable investing in crypto and also increasing the likelihood of the SEC approving crypto related ETF's."

If I have fiat for less than the treshold (? $200K) in a Bank saving account that is FDIC insured, I am guessing I will get my money regardless if the bank goes bankrupt?

Wondering if the samething applies with BTC that is offered by Bank/Paypal, *i.e.* bank/Paypal goes bankrupt but the saving (in BTC) will be insured upto the treshold (say equivalent to $200K or so)?  (I know the not your key not your coin)  
I believe BTC is treated more like an investment, so it is not insured?  

Just need to start somewhere, even if it is not ideal (like Paypal), while I get familiar with the whole crypto basics.  


Also, secondly, if the above is a not currently insured, which reputable &amp; legal US companies that that trade (buy/sell) BTC with a reasonable fee ?...1.5% to buy and another 1.5%  to sell is kind of steep, but that's maybe my interpretation of reading a company user agreement/policy.

I don't have much income so I'm starting slow but I'm hopeful that this will be a fruitful investment. Now I'm wondering a few things and I'd like the community's advice.

1) We all read the news about El Salvador but realistically it's going to take quite a while before other countries embrace Bitcoin as legal currency and not just an investment asset. Meanwhile, the exchange I signed up with offers an optional Bitcoin debit card that automatically converts the purchase value in BRL and deducts the BTC from my wallet. It doesn't really seem like a good idea to me. I'd rather hold on to my Bitcoins and pay for stuff with Reais like I've been doing up to now. What do you think?

2) How long is long enough to HODL? Are we talking months, years, decades, forever? I don't intend to become a day trader or time the market, that's a losing game. But I also wonder when it's okay to try and turn a profit, considering that inflation and other factors are likely to make my investment grow in relation to ""official"" money in a period of several months. I'm not looking to cash out completely - on the contrary, I hope to have more bitcoins at the end of the year than I currently have - but when is it okay to HODL a little less and regain some fiat currency that I can actually use?

3) Wallets and interests. My Bitcoins are currently sitting in a wallet owned by the exchange. In order to withdraw, I'd have to pay a withdrawal fee. While they sit in that wallet, my Bitcoins aren't really ""doing"" anything. If I withdrew them to a local wallet, they'd also sit idle. Which is safest? Also, I've heard of ""Bitcoin investment"" accounts that function just like savings accounts, earning a modest interest. That would also involve putting my Bitcoins out of my hands and into somebody else's but at least I'd be getting a little something back. What is generally considered to be the best way to store my BTCs out of these three? Is there another better option or another way to gain interest or dividends on my Bitcoins?

I know that with the small sum I have currently, these things probably won't make any difference for a long while, but I want to start off on the right foot, even if this is information for the future. I'm really excited to become a part of this and I thank you in advance for any and all replies. I'm also open to tips, constructive criticism and advice of any kind. Thanks for reading this far and may your profits be high!"

1623369440,Bitcoin,"Increasing bitcoin's divisibilityHow hard would it be technically to increase bitcoin divisibility beyond the satoshi level on the base layer? Would significant parts of the code need to be changed? Would a hardfork be necessary / to what extent could such a change be backwards-compatible with the blockchain and older clients? Can the divisibility be increased indefinitely or are there some hard limits beyond block size (which can be increased, within reason)?

Also, would there be any downsides, beyond the memory problem, of actually implementing such a change?

I'm aware of the possibility to take care of those things on a second layer, but maybe when hyperbitcoinization at some point occurs, it \*could\* make sense to be able to settle smaller amounts than 1 satoshi on the main chain, right? Even if we're talking many decades or more in the future, I would still like to know about the feasibility of such a change.

I hope some people with more knowledge than me could give an opinion, or guide me in the right direction (but please don't tell me I can study the source code for myself because I'm not far enough to attempt that at this point, let alone have enough time). Thank you."

Say they are eligible for a dual citizenship in Italy or somewhere similar overseas and decide to get it and then ultimately move to Italy and renounce the US citizenship. Anyone have any idea how that would be handled, financially speaking? 

1. Cash out to fiat and pay the US tax before renouncing then move and just wire money to a new overseas bank account?

2. Move to Italy, renounce US, then cash the crypto out to fiat after opening an overseas account? 

3. ?

I know the US has an “exit tax” but the chances of said person filing any further paperwork to the evil IRS if they are no longer a US citizen are slim to none.

The antitrust expert, who is known as a prominent big tech critic, has in the past questioned the value of bitcoin.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s tech advisor, Tim Wu, is a millionaire in bitcoin, Politico wrote in article this week, quoting his personal financial disclosure. The declaration has been provided to the publication by the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University, which requested the document from the White House.
According to the disclosure Wu owns between $1 million and $5 million in bitcoin (BTC) as well as between $100,001 and $250,000 in filecoin (FIL), the cryptocurrency of a platform that offers decentralized crypto storage services. The official information also reveals that Wu’s bitcoin investment is the largest holding in his financial portfolio.

Wu now serves as a special assistant for technology and competition policy to the president at the National Economic Council. In March, he went on leave from his position as a law professor at Columbia University to join the White House. He is considered a strong critic of the growing power large tech corporations wield."

The tide may have finally turned for cryptocurrencies in India as reports indicate a softer stance by the government toward crypto.

According to a report by The New Indian Express on Thursday, the government’s hostile stance toward Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be shifting toward more common-sense regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies.

According to inside sources quoted by the publication, authorities have dropped earlier plans for a blanket Bitcoin ban in favor of classifying cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India will reportedly be tasked with overseeing crypto regulations in the country in collaboration with the finance ministry.

These inside sources also claim that Parliament will debate a comprehensive crypto regulatory bill during the Monsoon Session beginning in July. An expert panel created by the finance ministry is reportedly studying protocols for crypto regulation and its finding could form part of the parliamentary deliberations next month."

1623456594,Bitcoin,"Mixed feelings about el Salvador adoption; radical change often is unhealthy changeIt seems that the leader of El Salvador is taking a very extreme measure because their situation is so volatile. The different things he is saying seem to be half baked (great goal and great direction, poor planning and poor collaboration). Everyone must accept as legal tender. 100% green energy mining. Powered by volcanos.

Here's why I think compliance is going to be very hard. It's a great idea to have Bitcoin as a legal tender but to require acceptance of Bitcoin as a form of payment means that people who do not know the technology are going to be very quickly frustrated and annoyed and the lack of information and clarity and collaboration makes this whole thing probably very alienating. Add on top of this that for a lot of people who do not use electricity for their sales imagine any fruit cart that doesn't accept debit card or credit card but only accepts cash they must now accept electronic payments. If you are rural and low income, and your livelihood just got complicated all of a sudden by some, young, urban politician you're not going to like this change.

This has nothing to do with whether I think this is good for the country I think it is. But it's the psychology and economics of the social exchanges. This is very hard and it's going to make you very unpopular and it is the kind of thing that makes thousands if not millions of people ticked off right away."

1623449920,Bitcoin,"Using a per transaction metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Here's Why: (x-post from r/cryptocurrency)I posted the following post on r/cryptocurrency because I was looking for a debate.  Perhaps here people can add to the arguments I have made:  
 
The ""PER transaction"" carbon, electricity and e-waste metric is such a deceitful metric. Anyone who uses it is willful ignoring that:  

* there are several other chains that are merge mined with the same hashpower as bitcoin (Syscoin is one of the biggest).  So does syscoin have zero carbon responsibility because it uses BTC's hash in merge mining ?  The authors of such metrics would like us to believe so.   

* There are hundreds of thousand of transactions that take place on the Lightening network.  Why are the authors of these ""per transaction"" metrics willfully ignoring all the activity on the Lightening network ?  Is it because they are to lazy to actually figure out how many transactions are taking place ? Or are they trying to push an agenda?   Besides lightening network, there are other layer 2 networks, like liquid.  Where thousands of transactions take place.  

* The current hashpower secures ALL PAST transactions.  The current hashpower isnt just used to write the current transactions in a block, but its used to secure every single previous transaction in bitcoins history.   

* The block reward is more than just a normal transaction.

 The block reward can be considered as a kind of battery whereby the electricity used to make hashes is transformed into a more easily kept and stored unit.  In a way,  these newly created bitcoin can be considered as a form of stored electricity.  The electricity used to create those bitcoins gets transformed into unit of accounts.  These units then can be transformed back into electricity via purchasing power that the BTC units have.  Or even more literally, they can be used to hire mechanical work from humans or other machines (using BTC to rent a generator that produces energy, or renting a solar array to charge a battery).  So figuratively the block reward acts as a sort of battery.  The energy isn't ""wasted""  its merely transformed into units that can be more easily stored over time and sent across the planet.  

The bitcoin energy usage discussion is a very nuanced one, and I believe it's very intellectually lazy to try to use comparisons of ""per transaction"".  Lets look at GPU gaming.  It uses more electricity than the bitcoin network, but it doesnt generate units of account that can be used forever (or as long the BTC network exists).  It just generates fun (at the time) and perhaps some fond memories.  
  Or take a look at x-mas trees lights (https://phys.org/news/2015-12-christmas-energy-entire-countries.html)  They can be considered not very useful in that they only provide ascetically pleasing lights for a tiny period, yet consume the amount of energy as small countries.  But again, bitcoin energy is transformed into units of account that can be used for as long as the network exists.  

Using a per tx metric to talk about bitcoin energy use is disingenuous and intellectually lazy. Bitcoins energy use is a more nuanced conversation than just ""per transaction"" so be suspicious of anyone trying to promote ideas about bitcoin based on them."

1623448766,Bitcoin,"Why I think Argo Blockchain is the future of bitcoin mining.Argo blockchain is a crypto mining company that focuses on green energy. They are helping to lead a miners coalition and push for renewable, sustainable mining techniques. They focus primarily on hydroelectric power, but have been setting up more wind powered rigs in Texas. They mine bitcoin, and zcash. Here are the reasons why I think Argo is the future of mining.

1. Margins are insane, they profit about 80% + for every coin mined. Just goes to show how much energy consumption matters. They can still remain profitable when bitcoin is 8k.

2. Diversified company, with stakes in Defi(WonderFi) also in NFTS

3. Peter handles ignorant questions well( See CNBC interview) Peter Wall has a background in media and is a great face for the company as well as a growth oriented CEO.

4. More institutional support, added to Bitcoin etf MSCI, IMI, black rocks ishares

5. NASDAQ listing is in the works to attract more American investors.

6. Argo has a similar hash rate to MARA  with 1075 peta hash (1.075 exa hash)

7. Texas facility being built = higher hashrate, also an expansion into wind power further sets them apart from fossil fuel miners.

8. More transparent than any other mining stock(I’m talking about you 🆘) Peter will answer any investor questions on his YouTube page, and they release frequent updates.

9. Absolutely no debt. Mara owes about 387,000$) Nuff said.


I personally think Argo is going to be best in class. Practically all the other miners use unsustainable techniques to mine their coin. As the push for green mining increases I can see RIOT and MARA falling behind. They may mine more coins, but Argo does it better.(imo)

Question 1. 

I see many people say that cyrpto will take over fiat currency, or eventually even make it irrelevant. Is this the general consensus around the community? How so, If cyrpto derives it's value from fiat?

2. Taking from the 1st question. How is it that if cyrpto derives it's value from fiat currency that it can remain decentralized? Would putting it in govt and financial institutions hands would lead to regulations? 

I had I 3rd question typed  but I answered it myself. About new crypto currencies appearing so quickly. 

Now these are the 2 questions,I have that I believe many people have along with the explanation of why  they should pick a currency and which one, and how it benefits the world. 

A concern I have not necessarily a question is that in order for crypto to grow and be sustainable as a store of value and help trade especially for impoverished nations, which from my understanding is it's purpose, then then it needs rapid widespread adoption for it to be achieved.

I'm starting to lean more bullish."

Sure enough it did. TLRY is one of those memers that has sort of been lagging since the last short squeeze of early Feb. It's definitely due for another run. It'll be interesting to see what happens to big coin &amp; our beloved memerzs after this weekend. The G7 summit is this weekend, and there has been growing pressure on Biden to speak about big coin taxation &amp; regulation. It's perceived as a threat to the US dollar. Especially with El Salvador adopting it as legally tender; it's only a matter of time before all of Latin America starts to buy it up (essentially guaranteeing a profit in a similar fashion to what Musk did when announcing Tesla's purchase of it).

Already we are seeing stiff resistance from the international central bank authorities with countries like Turkey completely prohibiting bitcoin to China where strict regulations bar its citizens from transacting in crypto, but mining activities are still allowed.

The IMF was designed to guarantee the stability of the world's monetary systems after WWII to prevent the worldwide economic depressions in the 1930s. The IMF was supposed to prevent unilateral decision-making that could cause currency devaluation. They failed their mission in 1971 when the US moved away from the gold standard. The US dollar has experienced an 85% inflation since then. The move by the US influenced other currencies to move to a ""floating standard"" model that is the value of the currency is determined by current market forces.

Currently El Salvador is seeking a $1 billion loan from the IMF. The IMF's rhetoric has caused concern with international bankers who've raised their interest rates on El Salvador's debits. This sends a very clear picture that central bank authorities are feeling threatened by the possibility of bitcoin becoming one of the world's reserve currencies."

1623535977,Bitcoin,"Massive FOMO, little savings and disposable incomeHello to my fellow HODLers. I've been lurking over buying BTC for ages, could have been a millionaire had I bought in when I first learnt about BTC; been a skeptic and a believer after that, but mostly a skeptic probably due to me trying to make myself think I was right being a skeptic and that BTC was a scam - born in the 90s, everything is a scam to me. 

I'm seeing the huge opportunity of this current dip and really want to buy in, but I'm broke AF, need to move house (so even more broke), living on a tight budget, debts and shit, and obviously little to none disposable income. 

I know the main rule of stock and crypto is to invest what you can afford to lose, but I have this massive FOMO and, like most of you have said, this is a huge opportunity and probably never going to happen again, at this price. 

Is it worthwhile if I invest £500 now? I can probably borrow and get £1000, which I'll pay off eventually, but with some effort. 

In your opinion, based on my personal circumstances, could these amounts become remotely life changing in the next 5 years?"

1623534600,Bitcoin,"[BITCOIN] The best Support/Resistance work you've ever seen! 

https://preview.redd.it/zq9xshntnw471.png?width=1517&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3072dc33524f5d52a0283cd286e6ffe61dce7679

I know this chart seems very difficult to read at first glance because of the number of lines it contains, however, this may be the best support and resistance work you have seen in years. I don't know if there is another chart like this out there, but I want to make it clear that I didn't use any other work or graphical analysis as a reference for creating this ""chart"".  


This analysis was quite bold on my part, I always looked for patterns in everything in my [life ](https://br.tradingview.com/symbols/OTC-VIDA/)but I couldn't believe that today I would find a possible pattern in something that could completely change my life and from many other people, maybe change yours, but that will only happen if you read what I'm writing and understand this chart.  


I dubbed this graph or analysis the ***Landz Logarithmic Curve*** after my name ""Landzz1"". I would like to mention that I still don't know if I put this work in Analysis or Educational since I will be explaining the idea trying to bring some theoretical points to support it, whatever!  


First, what is the **Logarithmic Scale**?  


According to Wikipedia, a logarithmic scale is a scale that uses the logarithm of a quantity instead of the quantity itself. Presenting data on a logarithmic scale can be useful when the data cover a wide range of values. The logarithm reduces the representation to a scale that is easier to visualize and manage. In the graph, as you can see, the farther to the right we look, the wider the scale becomes, and the farther to the left we look, the narrower it gets.  


***Whatever***, I'm not the Sherlock Holmes to stand here unraveling mysteries! I just want to know how to read this!  


Analyzing BITCOIN from 2011 to 2013 and also **Bear Market** that happened after December 2013 I could verify using the logarithmic lines that the price fluctuation *(up and down) of* this period does not quite correspond to the period we are going through. You can notice the difference in width from one line to another ( *Supports and Resistances* ) drawn on the first logarithmic scale (from the left), about the second (from the right) which is the one we are at now. **However**, I said, however, from the moment we concatenate each other, we can see in an **AMAZING**, **ABSOLUTE,** and **MAESTRAL** way that in which the supports and resistances are interconnected with each other. For **each line** intersection, if we draw a straight line to the right, we can see that it is part of a BITCOIN price support or resistance.  


As we can see in **Image (1)**, a horizontal line was drawn at the intersection points from the white line which is the line of which the ""**Top (All-time High)**"" is located, and as we can see, the result is ridiculously right.

 

Image (1)

https://preview.redd.it/x3z8ogywnw471.png?width=1467&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576f973c6aae4e9d86f92f133ecdecfe161258e0

To further clarify the color scheme of the lines, from **red dotted** line to **white** line. **Note:** (The white line is not dotted as it is seen as the top of the logarithmic pattern). So, it's like from bottom to top, and the **blue lines** are part of a continuation so we can use it at intersections in a future projection.  


Now I will enter a point from which I bring the Logarithmic Spiral theory. Also according to Wikipedia, The logarithmic spiral was studied by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705), who called this curve spiral mirabilis (Latin for marvelous spiral). The curve that forms with all the straight lines, located in its plane and passing through a fixed point of that plane, a constant angle. In practical real-life examples, we can find the logarithmic spiral in shells, hurricanes, and in the galaxy itself (the Milky Way).  


*Note: You can see in the graph that, as mentioned above, from the white line (the only one that is not dotted, top-line ""ATH"") all the blue dotted lines successively are considered as periods, where the colored lines of the current logarithmic, when they intersect, they will become support and resistance.*  


Although this analysis was done using the **1W** time period **as a base**, it is possible to **Zoom in** on a **1D** time period for example, and draw the horizontal lines at the intersections to find each of the supports and resistances. **Image (2)**.  


It's interesting to see how the lines narrow along the way due to the curvature of the logarithmical pattern, and yet the supports and resistances are there! **Voilà!**  


Image (2)

https://preview.redd.it/xd010j61ow471.png?width=1465&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9dc1fce37c0842d44a63db5773ec006e08af0b85

 In the next image, I'm going to bring in a three-dimensional aspect for people to see how this really looks like galaxy stuff. In **Image (3) it** is possible to see the logarithmic curves as if they were the rings of Saturn.  


Image (3) 

https://preview.redd.it/o8jgxc64ow471.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5aa97093583cb9e58dbcb7e3a03a9898f5a7476e

Finally and to finish this analysis as being the best support and resistance analysis you have ever seen in your life (just kidding, but maybe) I will show you the current path of BITCOIN and where will be its support and resistance lines that it will follow in the future. When the candles of Bitcoin moves to the next blue line, it will have support and resistance at the **Pink** horizontal line. See **image (4)**.

So, I end here my analysis of BITCOIN and I hope you liked it! Prepare yourself for the future, I'm not giving a value that the BTC will reach either up or down, but I'm already showing where all its supports and resistances will be in the future, so you can find the targets that best suit your analysis.  


If you have read this far, I would like to thank you for your patience, and if you work in any financial company or crypto company where is needed a professional analyst to draw and read macro charts even for day trading, please contact me, I would love to work for a company in this field. I am currently unemployed and that sucks!

&amp;#x200B;

[Twitter lightening button ](https://preview.redd.it/iqwwh165xv471.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab852e984eb739fcc2db0c40938b596891d440fd)

Each account would be able to register the address of an off-Twitter LN wallet into it, you could then donate some satoshis for any tweet you see through your own off-Twitter wallet, something like Brave do in their browser with BAT. 

It could be made in two ways: 1) a direct channel between the user and the donator or 2) with Twitter as an intermediate.

If it is a direct channel, I don't see how Twitter could verify if the transaction was successful or the one who clicked to donate didn't complete it. This would be bad for social media-wise since it would be only a wallet option without metrics.

If it has Twitter as a middle-man, the transaction could be made as donator -&gt; Twitter | Twitter -&gt; receiver. The address of the LN wallet would be private then, with Twitter being the only one to know it. The donation of satoshis through lightning would make the tweet appears for more people, something like Likes, Retweets, and Replies do, it could appear as X enlightened this tweet instead of liked/retweeted/replied, or could just make the algorithms better for the other ones. Twitter could receive a small fee so that would be profitable for them, let's say 1% and the minimum donation of 100 satoshis. 

The number that appears on the tweet could be the number of satoshis (or an unit of 100 satoshis, that is, the smallest donation possible) or the number of people who donated.

Twitter would build a major global financial integration. People who need help could easily receive financial support from the whole world with a single tweet. 

The Share tweet button could be moved to the three points up there."

March 19, 2013

I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.

Example last night when I ordered 2 pizzas I can only imagine ""that will be 48,200 Satoshis please"" WTF.

Countries like mine (USD rate is 57 to 1) will have a better transition with BITS (1/1,000,000 btc) but I hardly see anyone using that one, frankly I don't know any other denomination besides those two.

If there is a good resource for me to check out let me know! [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org) gave me a decent overview but I have deeper questions.

It seems as if the crypto is attributed to a wallet, which is attributed to an ""address"". Can anyone expound on this?? Id like to keep myself as anonymous as possible and maintain my privacy. That being said, how do i secure my wallet? Can i have access to the same bitcoin/crypto and have both a desktop and mobile wallet, and then an air-gaped copy of my wallet?

Which wallets do you guys like, and obviously i wont be able to buy an entire bitcoin so ill have to buy pieces, what sort of nuance does this add to the situation?

These are just some of my initial thoughts and questions, thanks for any resources and advice in advance!

As such, I am hoping to better understand some details I've researched but failed to retain. Please excuse my ignorance as there might be some gaps in my knowledge.

\- Where does the widespread acceptance and adoption of the lightening network fall into BTC's hierarchy of necessities? Will off chain transactions be required for scalability? Why hasn't this network become the norm? Is there a downside to implementing it?

\- Will BTC always stick with POW? I understand there is somewhat of a fallacy surrounding BTC's massive energy consumption, but as an environmentalist myself, is changing to less energy dependent system going to detract from what BTC has to offer?  Would changing to POS or a different validation system hurt BTC's efficiency, value, or adaptability?   


Side note: As far as those who resist a change away from POW as changing to a different system would be straying to far from the tech's original form -  I'd prefer not to get into a conversation of BTC dogma. This is more a question of logistics rather than ideology."

1623620643,Bitcoin,"New age of mercantilism?So let's imagine that statewide adoption of Bitcoin continues to spread from Central America and South America until it's the world's reserve currency. What would be the economic effects of a fixed, deflationary currency. Could this create a new form of mercantilism in the modern age? 

For those who don't know what mercantilism was, it was an eighteenth century economic theory centered around the scarcity of wealth (particularly gold). The idea was that because there was only a fixed amount of gold in the world, global trade was a zero sum game. In order to win this game, a nation had to export more than it imported, thus hoarding more gold and having more wealth than other nations. 

So, if Bitcoin is the world's store of wealth and there's only a fixed amount, could you see this causing a revival of mercantilist economic theory? Perhaps states and institutions might start to hoard as much bitcoin as possible and it could lead to extreme economic protectionism, tariffs, and limit free trade? 

I'm honestly just thinking aloud here and don't have a fully formed opinion on the matter so I'd love to hear some more perspectives! Thanks!"

      ""type"": ""bip9"",
      ""bip9"": {
        ""status"": ""locked_in"",

        ""min_activation_height"": 709632
      },
      ""active"": false
    }

and active from block 709632, it is a good idea to upgrade [the full node to 0.21.1](https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/) since it is the first version fully supporting taproot. [Version 0.21.0 had taproot coded](https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.0/) but no knowledge about the activation mechanism. 

The final activation will not happen until November but it's now time to be prepared. If you don't upgrade, the old nodes will consider the taproot transactions as ""anyone-can-spend"" so they will continue to work but without validating their correctness.  

It is also a good idea to upgrade wallets to versions that support new taproot bech32m address format.

For example, Electrum wallet supports bech32m since [version 4.1.0](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/4.1.0/RELEASE-NOTES)."

But the U.S. Empire scheme feels threatened by Iran burning oil for cash. So? What to do about it? Well, if the NSA could hack Bitcoin they would have. So apparently they can't. But what can the secret services do?

1623715590,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin = PetroDollar 2.0One of the biggest reason why the US Dollar has the power it has is due to the Petro Dollar system. This system makes the US dollar the biggest currency for oil trading in the world. Because of this, the US dollar is literally backed by oil.

With leaders like Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk looking at using renewable energy to mine bitcoin. Bitcoin is essentially becoming the petrodollar for renewable energy.

Regardless of how you feel about Jack and Elon, bitcoin will be used for renewables. As Jack said, Bitcoin is a great incentive for renewable energy. Considering that all energy usage must be used on the spot or stored for later usage, any excess energy on top of that is wasted. Bitcoin fixes that problem. It allows for anyone producing energy to make an extra income by using the excess energy to mine bitcoin. With bitcoin becoming literally integrated into renewable energy systems, bitcoin is positioned perfectly to be the next biggest currency backed by energy.

Those who say proof of work is pointless and kills the environment is wrong. Nonrenewable energy is what kills the environment, proof of work is just a means to use energy. Combining proof of work with renewables is a match made in heaven. No pollution, more incentive for green energy, and more power to a network that is controlled by no Government.

Edit: TLDR; Bitcoins proof of work algorithm will be used for renewable energy. This will cause Bitcoin to be directly tied to energy production and essentially be backed by energy. This may cause bitcoin the be more powerful than the petrodollar."

Hi,

if I'm unemployed currently and want to make some money out of my savings which I have (and other investments), does it make sense to start trading now? If yes, should I do it as P2P trading? Or on an exchange?

I do have a fairly good understanding of BTC and the use of BTC in India is quite popular. Since BTC is more popular is it better to trade BTC or some other crypto?

Any tips would be helpful especially from folks who have/had started trading as a fresher.

Also, I already have a higher level verified account on a P2P platform, in case I'm going for P2P, should I consider this platform?"

It ranges from finance, sports, comedy, and anything that sounds interesting to me. Just today, two separate podcasts under two separate genres had extended segments on Bitcoin being an environmental disaster that shows the shortsightedness of human beings and how a corrupt politician like El Salvador’s president embracing it just shows how it’s useful for criminals and “bad guys” only. I was so sad because I love the pods and hearing their ignorance was disappointing. Then I perked up at the realization that, honestly, this is just a reflection of how early we really are. I think it’s easy for us (at least me) to believe my echo chamber of the books I read and subs I follow are reflective of a larger consensus than it actually is. Talk to you parents, grandparents, siblings, coworkers; look at mainstream media; this is more reflective of reality. The massive majority of people are either (1) totally clueless, or (2) grossly misinformed. I just like these reminders from time to time that while I’m not wayyy ahead of the curve (and that can often be a dangerous place to be), I am still well in front of it.

1623882257,Bitcoin,"What Makes Bitcoin a Store of Value?
**A cup is not being useful when it sits in the cupboard, only when you drink from it. A bicycle is not useful when it sits in the garage, but when you ride it.** We can say that a bicycle or a cup are useful items, even when not currently in use, but it **is the ability to make use of them when needed that grants them this label of utility.**

Likewise, a broken cup or a bicycle damaged beyond repair ceases to be useful and becomes junk. This is because **value comes from utility** and not the other way around. A thing that loses its intended functionality loses its value. The broken cup may still find itself useful to the artist, but broken items tend to lose all worth and can generally be had for free… many people even pay someone else to collect their junk from them!¹

This article is about the “store of value” myth and how those who promote it are blind to the gaps in their logic. Gold is considered useful as a store of value because people know with certainty that when the time comes to actually use it, e.g., to sell it or trade it (or smelt it or forge it), that there will be someone else to buy it with little enough fuss. **Gold is useful as a store of value because it is universally regarded as something that has value.** Gold has value, and it can be an asset, but it is not money.

Bitcoin is different. It was invented, described, and marketed as a new form of money. Its only function was to serve the needs of its users by being a better way to transmit value from one person to another. It was (and is) revolutionary because **it marked the first time in human history people could transmit any amount of value across any distance or any border without the involvement of intermediaries and regulators. For the first time in human history, a person could send fifty cents from Tokyo to Tanzania as quickly and easily as they drop spare change in the hat of a street musician.** In other words, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.

Cash is regarded as something of high utility. It can be used at virtually any store, or traded to virtually any person you come across in day-to-day life. There are few people who would walk past a hundred dollar note on the ground without stopping to pick it up. Cash is hyper-useful because, like Bitcoin, and unlike previous attempts at electronic money, it can be given to any person, in any amount, without any oversight or permission required. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous inventor **Satoshi Nakamoto bridged the gap between cash and electronic money by creating the world’s first form of electronic money that had all the same monetary properties as cash. But it was superior to cash, because it did not have many of the negative physical properties that can work against cash. It can’t be confiscated, torn, burned, counterfeited, eaten by rats, and it does not weigh anything or occupy any space.** Carrying $100,000 in cash or gold through an airport is risky, but with Bitcoin one can memorize a mnemonic phrase and walk around with $100,000 in their brain and no one can stop them.

More revolutionary still, **Bitcoin also had many of the properties that make gold valuable while shedding the properties that make it inconvenient.** Bitcoin takes the best attributes of both cash and gold and boils them down to their purest essence.

Like the cup in the cupboard and the bicycle in the garage, cash in the wallet or under the mattress is only “useful” insofar as it can be reliably useful at the time one wishes to use it. **A trillion-dollar Zimbabwe note held by an American is regarded as a novelty, not counted as cash-on-hand. Even a strong foreign currency held in cash will be regarded as less useful than the prevailing local currency, because it won’t be as widely accepted and one often has to carry it to a bank or a money-changer to convert it to a more useful form of paper. This doesn't happens with Bitcoin which is becoming widely accepted everywhere in the world.**

Do Bitcoin whales create any issues for its long term application as a currency/store of value/whatever you believe Bitcoin can/should be?

I understand we can eventually refer to Bits or Satoshis, but does the long term effect of a small group of people holding a majority of Bitcoin cause an issue for the health of Bitcoin?

Maybe it will eventually be more broadly distributed as people start to adopt Bitcoin, and large quantity holders take profits and sell (seems to come in waves, but it seems most will hold), but is the current distribution of Bitcoin amongst a few whales going to cause an issue with the long term outlook? Is it fair to expect a Bitcoin dump at some point, and how will that affect it if Bitcoin has been broadly accepted and all of the sudden it crashes as whales take profits (if they choose to)?

I find the question to become more relevant as the Bitcoin whales start to become large institutions, banks and companies, while normal people in the world are just living off Bits and Satoshis. Almost seems like there'd be a ruling class of early Bitcoin adopters (congrats to you) and large institutions but are there any implications in that scenario.

1623974588,Bitcoin,"Please help to cash out BitcoinSo, maybe seven years ago a family member gave out what he said was a fraction of a Bitcoin to everyone for Christmas. All I recall is him saying that the USB he gave me was Linux. I shoved a USB drive and the slip of paper he gave me into a drawer and promptly forgot about them.

Fast forward to now, and we're no longer really on speaking terms, but I could use some monies and I thought about this old thing. I am not educated in cryptocurrencies even slightly, and have spent about a week on and off trying to figure out how/what to do with this thing.

Currently, I have a USB drive that seems to be Linux formatted. It also acts as a boot drive. I also have a sheet of passcodes labelled Generation Seed, Password, and Receiving Address. 

I believe I have everything I need in order to do anything with what I have, but I have zero idea how to do it. I have a laptop set aside for playing with Linux. I just started a Coinbase account, but that doesn't seem to have the option I need. 

Anyone willing to lend a hand?

EDIT: Just to cut down on the number of replies, don't worry folks, I will not be giving out a shred of the password info or anything. From peeking at the rates that BitCoins have been trading at, historically, we may only be talking about a couple hundred bucks.

EDIT #2: Okay! Thanks all. I got it all figured out. Woo. You were all most helpful, I definitely had hit a brick wall after about a week of being mildly frustrated about it. Got things moved over to Coinbase where I find out that I am now the proud owner of... &lt;drumroll&gt; ... ... $137!

Oi. Well, I went into this assuming that it was going to be a disappointing number. Guess I was right. Maybe I'll take someone out to dinner. Anyway, thanks Reddit!"

Not to mention being sent to residential schools, put up for adoption, etc. Many indigenous people nowadays are speaking out and going back to their roots, denouncing Canada and the US as a legitimate government in their eyes and only identifying with their own tribal nations and going back to their traditional governance system. Seeking actual nationhood, self-sustainability. Especially in Canada; Indigenous people are multiplying rapidly with amazing birth rates that far surpass any other demographic, they will need land and resources for their future. A future that is being sold by the Canadian government as they extract resources all around their traditional tribal-national territory. Could Crypto help with this at all?

1623966074,Bitcoin,"Saving Bitcoin for Children, Made Easy. - Feedback welcome!Hi Reddit, 

I was trying to gift some Bitcoin to my nephew and like a lot of posts I see on here, the whole process is awkward. Trying to decide how to safely store the coins, keep them separate and also manage the keys when the parent has an understanding of Bitcoin or Crypto in general.

I came with a solution [https://getnested.co/](https://getnested.co/) which I would like to know what you guys think about!

* Nested would allow anyone to create a specific wallet for a child in which they could buy and store Bitcoin. The wallet would have a predetermined lock-up period (for example when the child is 18) that would be set by the wallet creator. 
* All of the bitcoin would be stored with a 3rd party custodial company and always be in cold storage for maximum security of the fund. 
* The account owner could then contribute monthly and also invite family and friends to contribute to the fund if they wanted to. Due to the simplicity of the wallet the fees to purchase Bitcoin will be much lower than established exchanges such as Coinbase.
* Each account would have account ""guardians"". The ""guardians"" would be family or friends that have a vested interest in the child. Any withdrawals from the account prior to the pre-determined lock-up period would have to be approved by the guardians to ensure that the child is the recipient of the Bitcoin. 

Would love to hear what everything thinks about this idea and if it would make it easier to gift bitcoin to minors"

I believe whole heartedly this is the future, I do my best to spread the word and educate the people I know about Bitcoin and what it can do for them.

This community has provided me with much information and news allowing me to constantly learn and grow as an investor and supporter.

It feels great to be a part of a revolutionary economic and societal shift, and in the face of this dark cloud of fiat that has been hanging over our heads there is a ray of moonlight piercing through the dark night showing us there is light on the other side.

1623961801,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin death cross nonsenseI'm a little annoyed by the non-data-driven trading *wisdom* like selling at the typical MA50 / MA200 Bitcoin death cross nonsense. Here our current arising death cross:

[death cross nonsense](https://preview.redd.it/jjjjnxc9uv571.png?width=2550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45c12c715937360b177ce845feaa240ea8e04be5)

I was wondering why so many people just put up with this without doing any data-driven simulations on it. With a simple python script I have compared the death cross strategy with the bitcoin HODL strategy. Here is the result:  


[HODL vs. death cross](https://preview.redd.it/uuz4ljvgvv571.png?width=1028&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=434addca5d2cdf6dd59e58854386baaeb66b1b85)

The death cross would have turned $ 1 into $ 22,000.   


Sounds good right?   


But HODL would have given you $ 812,000. You would have missed -97.3% performance if you had listened to the death cross. Of course, historical backtesting is no guarantee for the future, but at least this data-driven analysis has brought the big picture closer to me.

Way before all the cookie cutter media stories etc. But never actually invested, just used it to buy stuff etc etc ..

Now I want to maybe put like half of every check I get into BTC, because it’s at a great dip of 35k, and I keep seeing news of huge supermines being in production .. I can see 50-60k within a year . easily. 

But maybe I should just invest half my check into savings account to generate interest? Not sure . I’m pretty sure coin is the way to go but don’t wanna do something stupid"
1624053571,Bitcoin,"Watch what happens.When those who use real estate as a store of value begin to understand bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is highly liquid, it can be sold and bought in seconds. There is no property tax (which in my state INCREASE EVERY YEAR). It is FIXED in supply. Won’t be able to create more of it, FOREVER. 

When this happens, I believe it will create a more fair world. Home prices will become more affordable, companies like BlackRock won’t be driving away the dream of home ownership just so they can preserve wealth for themselves.

Bitcoin is a far better store of value than practically anything else.

A reminder. There’s only ever going to be 21,000,000 of these. The supply is constantly decreasing through lost coins and incoming supply cut in half. Realistically there’s only 12 million coins out there, and that’s all there will ever be.

42 million millionaires out there, 12 million bitcoins, it doesn’t take a genius to see where this thing could go."

1624052289,Bitcoin,"Bank of England’s Bailey Wants to Regulate Crypto With ‘Tough Love’Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says there will be an element of “tough love” in regulating cryptocurrency. “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: “We must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.” He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen “in a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.”

Emphasizing, “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are “dangerous,” reiterating that they “have no intrinsic value” and “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they “have the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.” Bailey elaborated, “A key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.”

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England’s work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. “We’re going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,” he said."

1624051346,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Beach Town in El Salvador Bustles With Growth After BTC Becomes Legal TenderEver since El Salvador passed a bill that was approved by a supermajority in the Salvadoran Congress legalizing bitcoin as legal tender in the nation, the country has remained in the spotlight. Furthermore, there’s an area in El Salvador called “Bitcoin Beach” with a small group of beach villagers that are attempting to leverage bitcoin on a daily basis.
The Bitcoin Beach resident’s official Twitter account has amassed more than 27,000 followers since its introduction in 2019. The account grew massively following El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele officially announcing the legal tender plans. The Twitter account shows all the action that’s been taking place in Playa El Zonte since then.

“Bitcoin Beach team working late to produce educational material for 6 million future Bitcoiners,” the Twitter account tweeted on Wednesday sharing a number of pictures of the progress. According to the residents of the village, a great number of entrepreneurs are showing up to the beach to visit or help the bitcoin economy flourish.
The residents of Bitcoin Beach have shared a myriad of photographs covering the work that’s been done so far in the area. “Desks have all filled up at Hope House Bitcoin Beach shared workspace with bitcoin companies streaming into El Salvador – So of course we are building more space,” the group stressed the other day.

“Crazy Days here at Bitcoin Beach We are thrilled and humbled by the number of companies and governmental agencies that are putting everything into plans to support the rollout of Bitcoin as an official currency of El Salvador,” the Bitcoin Beach group further said."

1624046657,Bitcoin,"SOLUTION: Solar + Hydro Powered Bitcoin, Plus Recycling InitiativeThe best solution is to switch Bitcoin mining from coal powered electricity to energy that is created by solar power and hydro power. At least we could announce this as our ""goal"" and in the coming years take concrete steps, 1 step at a time, to make Bitcoin clean and shiny like my toilet bowl after I scrubbed it with bleach containing cleaning liquid.

We could also announce Bitcoin mining hardware equipment recycling initiative, ensuring that all components used to mine Bitcoin are properly recycled, without damaging environment.

The decision to go green would have multiple benefits for Bitcoin buyers and miners:

1. Instead of being in conflict with left-wing extremists and their climate change agenda, we could simply join them and invite them to buy some shiny clean and eco conscious Bitcoin.
2. On the other hand, we could use our newly created green economy to criticize legacy financial system for being dirty, using too much coal powered energy, and destroying the environment; thus, earning credibility among eco conscious population who is sceptical of cryptocurrency.
3. Once the dust settles, Bitcoin can finally start to enjoy wider acceptance and can increase it's market dominance to a fair market value level, like $1 million per 1 Bitcoin, and then in the following decade or two, 1 Billion per  1 Bitcoin, and higher.

In conclusion, we have to be smart. We can't just swim against the tide. Tell ""them"" what they want to hear, satisfy their left wing extremist agenda, let them hear ""Yes, we care"", and then we focus on business. But first we have to tell them what they want to hear. They are narcissist, sick, demented people, and all they want to hear is acknowledgment that we believe that climate is changing, and that we want to protect the environment.

Tell them what they want to hear. Let's move forward.

Solar + Hydro powered Bitcoin with Recycling initiative is something that needs to be widely circulated, so left wing psychopaths feed their inner sickness with a feeling of vindication, followed by a feeling of Bitcoin's acceptance."

1624134530,Bitcoin,"Dorsey: ‘Square Is Considering Making a Hardware Wallet for Bitcoin’The cofounder of Twitter and the CEO of the payments firm Square, Jack Dorsey, has revealed his firm is contemplating creating a bitcoin hardware wallet in collaboration with the community. Dorsey revealed this in a tweetstorm and said he wanted to share some “guiding principles” concerning this possible venture.
On Friday, Jack Dorsey tweeted about the possibility of Square creating a bitcoin hardware wallet and discussed a number of principles the firm is guided by when approaching the subject. The founder of Twitter and Square explained that what the company creates needs to be “open,” as he noted that “bitcoin is for everyone.”

“Square is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community,” Dorsey tweeted. “We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles. Bitcoin is for everyone. It’s important to us to build an inclusive product that brings a non-custodial solution to the global market,” the Square CEO added.

Dorsey then gave those who have already pioneered the noncustodial wallet space props, and asked his Twitter followers what the “biggest blockers to get a non-custodial solution to the next 100M people?” Numerous people answered Dorsey’s questions and a few responses discussed hardware wallets with no iOS support.
“iOS support. Trezor, up until now, still doesn’t support iOS for (good reason.) If you solve this solvable problem, you gain a huge portion of the market,” one individual responded to Dorsey’s Twitter thread.

“Custody doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing,” Dorsey continued. “We can probably simplify custody through ‘assisted self-custody.’ Assisted requires great product design: minimal setup time, relying on existing devices, and end-to-end reliability. How should we be thinking about assisted solutions?,” the Square CEO asked. He further added:
After Dorsey published his thread with about 12 different points, he said that Square and his team plan to “continue the conversation.” He further noted that a dedicated Twitter account would be on the way and a Github repository, as well, if the firm decides to build a hardware wallet.

“We’ll update this thread with that information when we’re ready. Thanks,” Dorsey concluded.

Dorsey’s hardware wallet tweet has accrued tens of thousands of likes and retweets since he announced Square’s possible hardware wallet venture. The Twitter CEO also mentioned that layer 2 capabilities and Cash App integrations with the hardware wallet are also important guiding principles.
Meanwhile, after the hardware wallet announcement, Dorsey attended the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami this weekend and was heckled by a conference attendee over “censorship” and “interfering in elections.”

“Why is Jack Dorsey on a stage at a Bitcoin event in the first place?” an individual tweeted in response to the heckling video."

Raftaar, an Indian rapper, lyricist, dancer, TV personality and music composer, made headlines this weekend for being the “first Indian artist to accept performance fee in cryptocurrency.” Raftaar’s real name is Dilin Nair.
The performance for which Raftaar will be paid in cryptocurrency is a one-hour virtual event in Ottawa, Canada, for a private group of about 100 people. It is scheduled for the second week of July.
“I’ve always been an ardent admirer of blockchain technology. I’ve always wondered why artistes and managers alike haven’t explored the potential of this disruptive medium,” Raftaar opined. “Nevertheless, I’ve finally taken the baby steps in this direction and all the credit goes to my manager, Ankit Khanna for making this dream a reality for me.”
The rapper did not mention which cryptocurrency he will be paid in, however.
Khanna, Raftaar’s longtime business partner and manager, commented: “In my opinion, music will be one of the first industries to be completely and thoroughly disrupted through the blockchain. The artist can now go directly to the public in every single way without the need of middlemen.”
Meanwhile, the Indian government has yet to announce its policy on cryptocurrency. A bill that seeks to ban cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, was scheduled to be introduced during the budget session of parliament but was not. There are now reports that the government is re-examining the proposals in the bill and is setting up a panel of experts to come up with new recommendations."

Mary Barra, the CEO of General Motors (NYSE: GM), talked about the prospect of the largest automaker in the U.S. accepting bitcoin in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.

Referencing Tesla CEO Elon Musk stating last week that his electric car company may start accepting BTC again, Barra was asked whether GM will be accepting the cryptocurrency for payments. She replied:

There’s nothing that precludes us from doing that. We will be driven by our customers. Certainly, we want to make the whole buying and ownership experience as easy as possible. We will follow their lead.
When Tesla announced in February that it would accept bitcoin for payments, the GM CEO said that her company was not interested in doing the same. However, in an earnings call at the end of March, Barra softened her stance on BTC and said the company would consider accepting the cryptocurrency “if there’s strong consumer demand.” She confirmed Wednesday that her company’s position on bitcoin has not changed.

Meanwhile, Musk said this week that Tesla will resume accepting bitcoin “When there’s confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.”"

1624127086,Bitcoin,"The World Bank has refused El Salvador’s request for help on the country’s transition to adopting Bitcoin as legal tenderThe World Bank has refused to support El Salvador’s request for help in the transition to use Bitcoin as legal tender.

It cited issues with Bitcoin’s environmental impact and transparency as reasons why it will not support El Salvador move to adopt Bitcoin as an officially accepted currency .

“While the government did approach us for assistance on Bitcoin, this is not something the World Bank can support given the environmental and transparency shortcomings, ” a World Bank spokesperson said.

The World Bank did note however that it can help El Salvador in other ways, including “currency transparency and regulatory processes.”
Earlier on Wednesday, Salvadoran Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said the Central America country had sought technical assistance from Banco Mundial (the World Bank).
Prominent Bitcoiners weren’t pleased with the World Bank’s refusal, but nor were they particularly surprised.

Bitcoin proponent Anthony Pompliano tweeted in response to the news that the “World Bank hasn’t figured out how to make money off Bitcoin.”

Samson Mow the CSO of blockchain development firm Blockstream, and creator of blockchain game Infinite Fleet, was irritated by the news — and called for The World Bank to be made obsolete.
While President Nayib Bukele’s Bitcoin law has sparked a lot of excitement from Bitcoin proponents across the globe, it has also received a lot of criticism. Yesterday, economist Steve Hanke said that El Salvador using Bitcoin as a legal tender may “completely collapse the economy.”

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also not keen on El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin. Cointelegraph reported on June 11 that it may hamper negotiations with the IMF over a $1B loan to support the country’s economy.

IMF spokesman Gerry Rice noted the adoption of Bitcoin presents a number of financial, legal and macroeconomic concerns that require a “very careful analysis”But some companies are rushing to help. Athena Bitcoin indicated it would move quickly to provide Bitcoin ATMs across El Salvador. On Twitter today, the firm asked Bukele if “1000 ATMs ” were enough, with the President replying in jest “1,000? How about 1,500?”

Yesterday, El Salvador’s Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Rolando Castro denied claims that ministry had begun discussing the option to use Bitcoin for employee salary payments, noting that it was “too premature to talk about wages.”"

1624126944,Bitcoin,"Bank of England’s Bailey Wants to Regulate Crypto With ‘Tough Love’Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey says there will be an element of “tough love” in regulating cryptocurrency. “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor said.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey talked about cryptocurrency regulation Monday at the annual conference of financial trade body The City UK.

He was quoted as saying: “We must, both domestically and working with international partners, ensure that we understand and respond to the public interest issues that arise here.” He said it will allow the Bank of England to protect financial stability while allowing innovation to happen “in a world where the public interest is well defined and protected.”

Emphasizing, “What we cannot have is a world where innovation gets a free pass to ignore the public interest. The odds of such an approach not ending well are too high,” the governor detailed:
Governor Bailey has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies. Last month, he said cryptocurrencies are “dangerous,” reiterating that they “have no intrinsic value” and “Buy them only if you’re prepared to lose all your money.”

He also talked about stablecoins, noting that they “have the potential to be systemic in terms of their importance for the financial system and its stability.” Bailey elaborated, “A key requirement will be to ensure that, unless the stablecoin is operating as a bank, the backing assets for stablecoins cover the outstanding coin issuance at all times.”

Moreover, the governor of the Bank of England warned against using cryptocurrencies for payments, stating:
Addressing the Bank of England’s work on a central bank digital currency (CBDC), he said the bank and the U.K. Treasury are weighing the potential of creating one. “We’re going to engage with users, the technology sector, to understand the potential for these things,” he said."

1624230268,Bitcoin,"Problems with dumping the contents of an old .dat walletI have this old wallet.dat file, originally created in Bitcoin Core around 2015-2016. Now, I'm trying to move all my Bitcoins from this wallet into an Electrum wallet because I simply cannot get Bitcoin Core to sync and load my wallet without problems (I've tried on several different platforms with different errors and I've given up on this route for the time being).

Anyhow, my mission is to export all private keys containing unspent transactions so that I can sweep them into Electrum. The first thing I did was to make a wallet dump using [jackjack-jj/pywallet](https://github.com/jackjack-jj/pywallet). This gave me all the addresses starting with ""1"", some of them contained in the list of receive addresses in Bitcoin Core and some of them being change addresses. However, some receive addresses, starting with ""3"" were obviously missing from this dump.

So, I fired up a fresh install of Bitcoin Core and used the dumpwallet command to export all my keys. This gave me a lot of addresses beginning with ""3"", including the missing receive addresses from the pywallet dump. However, not all addresses beginning with ""1"" that I found using the pywallet dump showed up for this Bitcoin Core dump.

So,  what I'm left with are two non-identical subsets of keys, and I don't know if there are more that I haven't been able to retrieve. However, if I were to understand why the two programs gives me different outputs, maybe I would be more confident that I've located them all.

First of all, I don't know why I have a mix of addresses starting with ""1"" and addresses starting with ""3"". Without really knowing, it seems like my wallet is some kind of mix between a HD wallet (generating addresses starting with ""1""?) and an old wallet where each address is generated individually (addresses starting with ""1""?). Since my wallet is filled with keywords suggesting a HD wallet (for example derivation paths and master private keys), I guess this is the case. If so, I still don't understand why Bitcoin Core won't dump all of the keys that pywallet can find. At least pywallet feels more consistent, since I only get addresses starting with ""1"" (I guess support for addresses starting with ""3"" are lacking).

Further, there are two things I really don't understand. If I have a HD wallet, shouldn't I be able to generate an infinite addresses? I realize that Bitcoin Core can't print all of them since I don't have an infinite hard drive, but how is it decided which one will be shown? Some kind of internal track record of all my transactions? Also, when reading [the wiki page about addresses starting with ""3""](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Pay_to_script_hash), it says ""To spend bitcoins sent via P2SH, the recipient must provide a script matching the script hash and data which makes the script evaluate to true."" Does this mean that the private key contained in my dump from Bitcoin Core won't be enough?

Sorry for this brain dump about my wallet dump, but I've been looking into this for months now. I would really appreciate any help."

The  market's crashed and I tell my friend, who managed to garner the least  interest in crypto, that now's a great time to buy since coins are  pretty much cheap, and that he's going to regret it when it all  skyrockets.

Nevertheless his  confidence in it seems to have been shaken by the recent drop, and in  spite of roughly grasping the value of cryptocurrency as a game-changing  tech, he keeps pussyfooting, stating that there isn't enough factual  information that Bitcoin and the crypto market are truly going for a  massive rise some time soon.

Granted,  I'm really into crypto as a ""rational believer"", i.e. I have too much  logic-based faith in it (and equal disbelief in the current financial  system) not to invest in it and hodl. Therefore I must admit don't  really follow what's going on, save for the big changes – as much as I  like crypto, my life doesn't revolve around it.

**BTC is King** \- I am not a Bitcoin Maximalist though

While ALTs definitely have a place in the crypto space, the future is certainly centered around the oldest and most well-known crypto out there, the mighty BTC.

Therefore, if you want to make money trading or investing in crypto (assuming you know what you are doing eg. selling the top and buying the bottom) the most efficient way is to cycle your money around. **However, no matter how appealing it is to sell your BTC for potential higher returns on ALTs, it is vital not to do so.** Why? I would much rather own BTC in a falling market, rather than some newly founded token, as the king will definitely recover, whilst your new investment may turn out to be a flop.

*ape language: more money goes into BTC than any other crypto; you hold BTC forever; you sell all other coins when price is good; you invest in BTC again; you HODL; you become rich rich*

Use this watchlist to help you guide the world of crypto. And while prices of tokens rise, don't become a ""moon-boy"" and turn into a bag holder.

**The China Ban**

China has taken another step to ban Crypto-currency. About 65% of the world’s Bitcoin mining took place in China as of April 2020, according to an estimate by the University of Cambridge. One of the strongest critiques of Bitcoin has been a 51% attack (a bit complex, we will speak generally here) against the network. This involves controlling over half of the network and using that control to manipulate, steal, and fabricate Bitcoin. **This critique had extraordinarily little validity due to a lack of financial incentives to do so, but now it is completely removed as a possibility.**

**Financial Institutions Across China**

            Last month, China imposed new sanctions on financial institutions. “China has banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and warned investors against speculative crypto trading.” - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-financial-payment-bodies-barred-cryptocurrency-business-2021-05-18/)

            The institutions cannot advise towards registration, trading, clearing, and settlement, or any other facet involving the processing of Crypto, this means no Exchanges are allowed to operate. Inner Mongolia didn’t think these actions were enough, as reported on May 25th.

**Inner Mongolia**

“The Inner Mongolia Development and Reform Commission said in the proposed rules that telecommunications companies and internet firms which are engaged in crypto mining will see their business licenses revoked by regulators.” - [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-inner-mongolia-escalates-crackdown-cryptomining-2021-05-25/)

            If you provide telecommunications or internet to miners, they will take your business from you. ***Read that again.***

**PANews Report**

“PANews reported on June 17, according to an insider who told PANews that the Sichuan Ya'an Energy Bureau and the Science and Technology Bureau held a meeting today and made a resolution to clean up and rectify Bitcoin mining companies in Ya’an. In addition, mine owners have been notified that due to the discussion of Bitcoin and other virtual currency mining at the meeting of the Ya'an Municipal Government in Sichuan on June 17, all power stations in the region will be shut down before 22:00 for self-examination, and the specific power-on time will end tomorrow. We will notify you later. According to news from the block rhythm, Sichuan Ya'an has implemented a “one size fits all” policy for mines, and all mines must be shut down before the 25th, including electricity consumption and hydropower disposal.” – [Release Here](https://www.panewslab.com/zh/sqarticledetails/1623943956574073.html)

            “One size fits all”, this means electric, coal, hydropower, it’s all irrelevant. If it’s a mine, it’s getting shut down. Ya’an controls 10% of Bitcoin mining in Sichuan. They were demanding the closure of 26 suspected cryptocurrency mining projects by Sunday. As of today (Sunday, June 20th), the hash rate has fallen, and the mines are offline.

**Screen, Cleanup, and Terminate**

The Sichuan Provincial Development and Reform Commission and the Sichuan Energy Bureau issued a joint notice on Friday, ""screen, clean up and terminate”.

“We had hoped that Sichuan would be an exception during the clampdown as there is an electricity glut there in the rainy season. But Chinese regulators are now taking a uniform approach, which would overhaul and rein in the booming Bitcoin mining industry in China,"" Shentu Qingchun, CEO of Shenzhen-based blockchain company BankLedger

This hydropower generated from the rainy season will be wasted, it was actually more harmful to ban the mines here. The Global Times estimates 90% of China’s Bitcoin Network is estimated to be shut down, equal to one-third of total processing power.

Miners were told to shut down by June 25, which includes the consumption of electricity and the abandonment of using hydropower. 

**Eradication**

“A Ya’an government official has told at least one Bitcoin miner that the city has promised to root out all Bitcoin and Ether mining operations with a year, said a person with knowledge of the situation.” - [Bloomburg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-18/hydro-rich-chinese-city-is-said-to-clamp-down-on-crypto-mining)

**In Closing**

Authoritarian regimes will always seek to undermine and manipulate any policy they can for their own benefit. Bitcoin mining was a profitable venture that appeared as no threat; therefore, China strove to be the center of mining, which it was achieving.

            China also has a deep understanding of technology, specifically Blockchain technology. With Nation-state adoption from El Salvador, those that are latching on to the Bitcoin Standard do so because they want non-inflationary (or programmed inflation), programmable money that cannot be manipulated or controlled by anyone. The boom of China’s hybrid Communist-Capitalism has largely been driven by their capacity to manipulate their currency and allow cheaper manufacturing to flow through their nation. Adopting the Bitcoin Standard is willfully giving up the most successful economic tool they have as a nation-state.

            The exodus of miners fleeing China from the repressive regime will largely impact the growth of another nation-state that welcomes these refugees. This will create competition in order to drive miners from one country to another, resulting in greater decentralization, and show the flexibility of this network to adapt overnight, further strengthening the core of Bitcoin.

1624217400,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is bad for China’s world domination plans.I’m throwing darts here but would be awesome if someone did the research. Just from growing up loving to play every type of strategy game devised, China is on a path to world domination, and they are realizing that Bitcoin is a factor they didn’t take into account for their 100 year plan to world control. 

Typically to “win the game” you first collect as much resources as possible. (World reliance on manufacturing) Then you start taking other’s resources from them. (Foreign investment in land and currency) Lastly when the rest can no longer afford to replenish their resources, it’s easy pickings to snap up more territory. (China is Currently flexing military power on the world stage) 

As I see what has happened over the last 30 years in Geo-politics. It’s pretty close to what China has been employing. 

Having a currency they are unable to manipulate, or control, available to the world. Puts a major thorn in the side of the plan to world domination.

Unfortunately for them it’s too late, the genie is out. Bye-bye centralized manipulations"

There are hundreds of million of people who own Bitcoin, but there are only 53 million wallets.

Given that exchanges and whales each have dozens/hundreds of wallets, it's likely that only 25 million unique people have Bitcoin wallets.

1. Not your keys, not your coins
2. When holding your coins on exchanges, you assume massive counterparty risk
3. Exchanges use the coins to lend/borrow as needed, allowing rehyothecation (which is bad for the price of Bitcoin).

1624213664,Bitcoin,"Can someone explain to me the need of a store of value?What is the point of having a store of value (gold, silver, bitcoin). I know BTC is unique in that it is digital and deflating, but what is the point of having a \*designated\* store of value \*at all\*.

For example the fiat dollar is, in my opinion, backed by the assets it can buy. That is houses, computers, tech, weapons, etc. Yes the government has control over the fiat dollar (can print fiat and manipulate interest rates etc.) Now if we change what the dollar is backed by to, let's say, gold or BTC. The government can still just print more money and inflate the economy in the same way, right? The value of the dollar would be diluted, just as it would be diluted in the current system. Or is the caveat here that the government wont be able to fluctuate the \*interest rates\*? Because the interest rates are bonds?

1624208808,Bitcoin,"When federal digital currencies become a reality, how will that affect bitcoin?Already we can see that China plans on making the digital yuan a near reality. They have invested in blockchain technology and they plan on getting rid of bitcoin, its main competitor. The sentiment from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is that they will only back digital coins that are issued by other central banks. Nationalists that are interested in protecting the value of their currency as well as the banking elite will always attack bitcoin. We have seen that happen in Turkey. Turkey's lira is experiencing rapid inflation so many of investors have started to put their money in bitcoin for safe keeping. Unfortunately Turkey has banned all cryptocurrencies.

China's digital yuan has the capability of tracking people's spending habits, where they send their money and potentially where they live. When you look at the future of digital currency, it may be headed towards the CCP's goals. There will be absolutely no freedom with spending habits being traced. This would be good for the government that is interested in stopping money laundering but it'll also introduce a new level of technological privacy invasion. When the ""Fed Coin"" becomes a reality, I don't think most people would trust it very much. "

As if that wasn’t bad enough, China’s plan for a nation state digital currency is similar to North Korea’s internal “internet.”  As we have discussed over and over again, open systems beat closed systems.

1624312300,Bitcoin,Bitcoin Analysis: Key Levels and Possible Targets
1624312219,Bitcoin,"Common musings of a new bitcoin HOdLer.I became a Bitcoin maximalist 6 months ago. I started buying it at $30k and kept buying it till $62k when I ran out of all my savings. I am a HODLer. I have spent a lot of time reading and understanding bitcoin. I have also spent time reading the arguments for and against it. And I feel like very few people, if any, truly understand what Bitcoin is and how it works. Following are my thoughts and honest opinions on some of the most common questions and arguments I come across online. I don't claim to be an expert, so read it with a huge grain of salt. 

1.	Is this a bull or a bear market?

Don't know, and don't care. Bitcoin is not for trading. It is for holding. 

2.	 Can bitcoin actually fail and some other crypto become more more successful?

Maybe. It is certainly not outside the realm of possibility. 

3.	So why HODL?

Because I believe that it will not fail. Part of this belief is pure conviction, but majority of it is based on the timeline and on the tech, as well as human psychology. Believe it or not, a big reason bitcoin is unlikely to fail is because HODLs refuse to sell. Ever. 

4.	Is there anything that can convince HODLs like me to sell?

Aside from critical financial emergency, no.

5.	Do you know you are batshit crazy?
Yes.

6.	Are you not worried about losing all your savings?

No. I truly believe that bitcoin will not fail, so I am not worried.

7.	Do you realize you might be part of a cult?

Yes. 

8.	Aren't you worried you've been brainwashed?

No. My conviction stems from the effort I put into understanding Bitcoin and to an extent, modern economy. It made sense. I couldn't make it **not** make sense. And so I was convinced this is the right decision.

9.	Are you sure you won't regret this decision?

No, I might regret it. But I'm ok with that possibility. If there is any huge risk I am comfortable with taking, it is this. Nothing else has ever made more sense to me. 

10. Are you a libertarian or a conservative?

No. I'm a liberal.

11. Then don't you care about the environmental impact?

I do. But I believe the energy consumption is worth it. And I think this will become more evident as adoption increases. We don't question the energy consumption of banks precisely because way more people have bought into it. But the underlying infrastructure takes the same effort regardless of how many people adopt it. 

12. Do you think everyone will use bitcoin at some point?

No. Bitcoin is not user-friendly. It is not intuitive. 

13. Aside from money, what other reason do you have to put so much time and faith into this technology?

Because I can see that if it succeeds, Bitcoin will drive us into the next phase of technological progress. You cannot put a price on the value of **truth**, and bitcoin enables you to transaction with truth as money."

What should he have done?A guy I know bought a bit too much in late 2020 bc he was already up big, had a well paying job and virtually no debt/liabilities. Then...kept DCA until he lost employment in May 2021 right while BTC crashed from $65k to $40k. He didn't want to sell at the bottom, so kept waiting...til today at the worst possible time when BTC was down and no income stream but needed to pay rent and had a big a car repair last week.

Felt bad for the guy but essentially what he sold was the portion he went in heavy when it was right under $20k. So while BTC was down, his realized gains were over 50% profits. Not bad. Plus this was just a portion of his stack so he's still a HODLer as much as he can be.

Obv reckless and lucky, but what do you think about people like this who weren't in completely over their heads at the time of investment but eventually came to be due to a big life change? What should he have done differently?"

1624407973,Bitcoin,"Concerned about the GBTC discountGBTC always traded at a premium, and usually a significant premium, for the entire history of the fund until February 23nd of 2021 it started trading at a discount (one day after the Canadian ETF launched and 2 weeks after Tesla Bitcoin announcement). Ever since, it has been trading at a discount and has never turned positive despite a massive crash in the underlying asset.

&amp;#x200B;

As we know, over the last few months there have been an explosion of new stock tickers tradfi uses to get ""exposure"" to bitcoin. Square, Overstock, Microstrategy, ARK ETF, Tesla, Coinbase, the many miner stocks, and now 3 Canadian ETFs.

Is it because to do so requires we change the definition of the term, or it exists in a completely different context than the one we currently use?

1624404066,Bitcoin,"A message to allOne decade and two years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new currency, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all coins are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that coin, or any coin so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure in this world. We are met on a great battle-field of that market. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their tendies that that coin might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, rich and broke, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the hodlers, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored hodlers we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of their savings -- that we here highly resolve that these hodlers shall not have bought in vain -- that this coin, under Nakamoto, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the blockchain, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

1624395584,Bitcoin,"How to keep your Bitcoin safe ?**Bought crypto at a great dip. Now what ? How do you keep your coins safe ?**

Now that the markets are dipping, I felt this would be a good time to post about how to keep our crypto safe as we expect the veterans to pull in their friends and family into the crypto markets. This will help all the newbies navigate the security measures in cryptoverse.

&amp;#x200B;

* **ENABLE 2FA Authenticator everywhere. Use a separate email for crypto. Use google authenticator instead of SMS authenticator. NO QUESTIONS ASKED.**
* **You take it off the exchange. You do not leave your coins on the exchange.  "" NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS.""** The only times I leave coins on the exchange is when I know that I am looking to buy more coins in the next several hours. That way I avoid paying fees multiple times to withdraw from the wallet. But with coins like ADA , SOL, ONE where the fees is so low that it might even be worth getting the coins off the exchange even if you do intend to buy more coins in the next 12-24 hours.  **Alternatively, if you bought BTC or ETH/ERC-20 tokens,** you could possibly wait till your done accumulating for the session and then pay the fee at once to pull your coins out. Sure you have to pay the transaction fees but hey, that's the cost of doing business here.
*  ALWAYS do regular scans on your main computer which you use to buy/store your coins for malware and other threats. 
*  Never publicly reveal your holdings. Never trust anyone who reveals their holdings publicly either. They are either malicious or they are lying or they are just stupid. You do not need to associate with such people in any case.
*  Never use the email you use for your social accounts as your exchange's email. If you have made that mistake already, consider changing the mail or alternatively changing the account. Yes, it may sound extreme but it is worth it.
*  Do not visit shady websites from your main computer. Sure, you may have anti-virus but do not risk it. Especially avoid visiting illegal websites that stream shows, sports events and porn.
*  Do invest in a hardware wallet as soon as you feel it is worth it. BUT MAKE SURE that you buy directly from the manufacturer's website or from a very reputable retailer.
*  I would always suggest choosing wallets which have multiple assets storage over  storing your assets in separate chrome extension wallets. Particular example comes to mind with EXODUS vs YOROI when staking ADA. It might be an unpopular opinion but for those who do not own BOATLOADS of ADA, in my opinion, I feel it is better to use EXODUS even though you get 0.8% less APY. You can store multiple assets on the wallet. Just making the entire process easier. And incase you do own BOATLOADS of ADA, you should be using Daedalus wallet anyways. Just my opinion. Take it with a grain of salt.
*  FACT CHECK EVERYTHING. I have lost quite a bit (not crypto but in general) by not questioning people because I was afraid I would offend them. If they are correct, they will always be delighted to prove their point. 
* DOUBLE CHECK EVERYTHING. Double check whether you pasted the correct wallet address. Double check the authenticator code. Double check whether the girl you like is only into you for your crypto. Double-checking never hurts.

1624495704,Bitcoin,"Is the bitcoin halving cycle being invalidated?We are all aware by now that historically, halving dates are the start of bull cycles. This belief was further strengthened by the arrival of the S2F and S2Fx model of PlanB. 

Mathematically or statistically, the way S2F and S2Fx were done is pretty dubious. You can further read about it here. [S2F](https://www.coindesk.com/why-the-stock-to-flow-bitcoin-valuation-model-is-wrong)

To summarize that, the S2F model is too linear or too predicated into a single aspect of asset valuation. 

That S2F model may have work in determining 2013 and 2017 runs because retailers are still king during those times. With the arrival of institutions and corporations and even nations, the valuation of bitcoin may not be as easy as before.

So, that prompted the question, are we are already in the process of invalidating the four-year cycles? Meaning, halving dates' impact will be getting lesser by the days and bitcoin will now be traded like a usual asset like gold, fiat and etc. Wherein cycles are determined by different macro things, not only stock-to-flow ratio.

I think this can be confirmed if we will continue to be below $50K for the next three-four months, and then we still end up creating a new ATH next year. Although, a much harder confirmation will be a new ATH by 2023 or simply, a weak bear market. 

The invalidation of the halving cycles has a lot of pros and cons. But the biggest thing for me is simply the possibility that bitcoin will now be traded just like how every other store-of-value-assets are being traded.

That way, we can have a much clearer picture of how it really differentiates itself from gold and fiat."

1624495240,Bitcoin,"One BENEFIT of a market downturn: You can save a TON of $$$ on your taxes with this one simple crypto loop hole**One benefit of a market downturn:** You can save a TON of $$$ on your tax bill for next year with this one simple crypto tax loop hole. Let's discuss...

If you sell or trade your crypto when it is below the price you originally acquired it for, you incur a capital loss. Capital losses get deducted from capital gains on your taxes, and overall, they reduce your taxable income for the year.

**E.g.** Let's say you bought bitcoin at $55,000 a month ago. If you sold or traded that BTC at market prices today ($32,000), you would lock in a capital loss for the year and significantly lower your taxes.

But it gets even better: Because the IRS classifies cryptocurrency as property and NOT as a security, ""wash sale"" rules do not apply to crypto as they do for stocks. This means you can buy the BTC that you sold back immediately and still realize the capital loss.

This is even MORE important if you have incurred gains earlier this year. Remember, capital losses deduct from capital gains on your tax return during the year they were realized. So if you've already ""realized gains"", you should take losses if possible to offset these gains.

**E.g.** Let's say you traded ETH for [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) at the height of the market. In doing this, you realized a taxable event and likely huge taxable gains as ETH was at all time highs. However, now your [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is underwater (worth less than you got it for).

So, if you sell out of [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) today, and then immediately buy it back, you will realize losses and offset a lot of those gains that you realized from your trade of ETH to [$MATIC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=cashtag_click) This could save you a TON on your taxes. I know someone who reduced his tax bill by $43,000 by doing this!

This is a process known as Tax Loss Harvesting, and it's a strategy rich people use all the time to lower their capital gains tax bill every year (more info [on TLH here](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-loss-harvesting)).

Also, you can use crypto tax software tools like CryptoTrader.Tax or BitTaxer to automatically detect your biggest tax savings opportunities for you. (The tools cost money, but you can test them out for free)

**So in summary:** Take a look at your current positions and see if there is any opportunity to ""harvest"" losses. Doing this proactively can lead to HUGE tax savings for next year."

1624494813,Bitcoin,"Before approving the VANECK Bitcoin ETF, the SEC needs your view on the following&gt;The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange’s statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice,17 in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are commenters’ views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters’ views generally on whether the Exchange’s proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters’ views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the bitcoin markets, the bitcoin markets’ susceptibility to manipulation, and thus the suitability of bitcoin as an underlying asset for an exchange-traded product?
2. What are commenters’ views of the Exchange’s assertion that regulatory and financial landscapes relating to bitcoin and other digital assets have changed significantly since 2016? 18 Are the changes that the Exchange identifies sufficient to support the determination that the proposed listing and trading of the Shares are consistent with the Act?
3. The Exchange states that “approving this proposal . . . \[would\] allow U.S. investors with access to bitcoin in a regulated and transparent exchange-traded vehicle that would act to limit risk” associated with retail exposure through other means.19 Further, the Exchange asserts that “the manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by quantifiable investor protection issues.”20 What are commenters’ view regarding such an assertion?
4. According to the Exchange, “\[n\]early every measurable metric related to \[Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s\] Bitcoin Futures has trended consistently up since launch and/or accelerated upward in the past year.”21 Based on data provided and the academic research cited by the Exchange, do commenters agree that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) now represents a regulated market of significant size? 22 What are commenters’ views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on CME to manipulate the Shares? What of the Exchange’s assertion that the combination of (a) CME bitcoin futures leading price discovery; (b) the overall size of the bitcoin market; and (c) the ability for market participants to buy or sell large amounts of bitcoin without significant market impact helps to prevent the Shares from becoming the predominant force on pricing in either the bitcoin spot or CME bitcoin futures markets?
5. What are commenters’ views on the Exchange’s statement, generally, that bitcoin is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin?24 What of the Exchange’s assertion in support of such statement that significant liquidity in the spot market and the decreasing impact of market orders on the overall price of bitcoin mean that attempting to move the price of bitcoin is costly? 25 What of the assertion that offering only in-kind creations and redemptions provides unique protections against potential attempts to manipulate the Shares and that the price the Sponsor uses to value the Trust’s bitcoin “is not particularly important”?

Firstly it has to be a store of value to make it comparable to Bitcoin. I'm not comparing bitcoin to Ethereum or others defi crypto/blockchain. Because I really believe that Bitcoin is more to compare as a store of value, where ETH is a decentralise system.

No need to explain why it has to be secure, but why feeless ?
Because if we want BIG BIG performance we need this crypto to be adopted by a really large amount of people. And to make it use by everyone in the world this crypto has to be 100% free for every transactions. 
Why ? Because paying 0.1/0.5/1/2/3/10/20 etc. dollars each times we buy something isn't imaginable because it would be a real problem for every little payments and poor people adoption. Imagin if your bank would tax you 1$ for each payments you do ? It's simply impossible to afford.

Why ecological ? Because if all the umanity use this crypto as an everyday payment, it's unthinkable to believe that each futur transactions would cost an anormous amount of energy, growing even more each time the bigger people's adoption it become.

Why scalable ? Simply for making it usable as a very, very large amount of people.

Why fast ? It's simply logical to understand that we need an instant payment for everyday purchases, like with our credit card.

How does the seed words coordinate with btc blockchain, eth blockchain and the 2 altcoin blockchains. Like i know each word in the seed words is a number so all 26 words create a giant code number so that code number identifies your share on the btc blockchain, and that same number identifies your share on the eth blockchain and so forth? Is that how it works?

Another follow up question is if i have a wallet lets say nano s, i use it and then drain it empty so theres no crypto on it. Then i close the wallet reset the ledger, and throw away old seed words. What happens to that wallet it no longer identifies anything and is shut down and lost forever? Like those seed words can never be generated again to identifies one owned portion of crypto on a blockchain?

1624580722,Bitcoin,"By popular demand: a deep-dive analysis of media sentiment surrounding bitcoin over the past 90 days (3/25-6/23),We will analyze Bitcoin’s news conversation over the past 90 days, and determine whether it’s currently overhyped or if now is the time to snipe.

In 2021 $BTC price has followed a head and shoulders pattern, starting the year at $30K, doubling to an elated peak of $63K per coin in mid-April, and falling back down to the $30K-$40K price range in recent weeks (the past 90 days are shown in the chart above). Some speculate that this puzzling performance is indicative of institutional manipulation (search “Wycoff BTC” on Twitter

One thing is for sure over the past 90 days: Bitcoin has gone from an emotional high of significant optimism to one of the most pessimistic and fearful tickers on the internet, and it has taken the entire cryptocurrency market with it. As of today, the investor sentiment Fear &amp; Greed Index points to “extreme fear” 

over the past 90 days Bitcoin news sentiment has trended definitively downwards, falling below the neutral line from optimistic to pessimistic just last week.

Overall, $BTC was still more optimistic and less speculative than both the FAANG stocks and S&amp;P 500 in the news over the last 90 days.

we can see a clear correlation between the weekly price of Bitcoin and its news sentiment and time-sense.

Bitcoin’s news sentiment showed a 0.496 correlation with price (considered significant), and Bitcoin’s news time-sense showed a -0.766 correlation with price (a strong correlation) over the past 90 days.

news is more reactive and past-oriented when things are going good, but when things take a turn downwards, news articles tend become more speculative. 

So where does this leave us?

This is the part of the report where we determine if Bitcoin is currently overhyped in the news (and due for a correction), or if it’s underhyped and time to put some money into it. We call this our Hype-Or-Snipe scale, 

Based on our analysis, we have determined that Bitcoin is currently SLIGHTLY undervalued in the news, and receives a Hype-Or-Snipe rating of +0.05.

Lightning Network gets a lot of fud even here in this sub. I suspect a lot of you guys haven’t yet actually tried it. It really is a lot easier than i think most people expect, and here is me trying to prove it. 
I suspect that the big hurdle right now is that you have to move your coins onto the lightning Network, so the idea behind this post is actually giving away MY satoshis so you do not have to do this to experience lightning. Hopefully some other experienced lightning-users will join me if this ends up a costly adventure. (Please lets keep this thread  focused on giving people the first experience with lightning)

HERE’S the plan:
-Go download Wallet of satoshi. This is a really really easy lightning Wallet. It IS custodial, but ignore that for now

-post your adress/qr here. I will send you 200 sats as soon as I can. I will answer you when i do,  and if I don’t get to tired I’ll post how many Sats it cost to send. IF someone else wants to join me, just send sats, and answer the post in the same way.

-when you recieve the sats, congratz! You have bitcoin in the lightning Network. Find a friend, pay it forward.

-Should you choose to explore this further, go download breez Wallet. You now have a non-custodial Wallet, and you can create an invoice (recieve via invoice) for yourself and pay from Wallet of satoshi and my sats. No risk, its someone elses money. You have now made your first transaction and are probably starting to Get it.

-With the sats well placed in breez, go to the apps-section from the top left corner. Pick the lightning roulette app,  fund with 20(!) sats (press «open in Wallet»), and gamble HALF of your deposit. Then go to the menu and press «withdraw using webln», and watch your remaining sats return to your breez balance. How cool is that?

-now: IF you want to experiment with moving YOUR coin onto breez, you have to make an on-chain transaction(recieve via btc adress) but breez assumes that you want any bitcoin on the lightning Network, and any recieved coin wil be on lightning. There are fees."
1624569712,Bitcoin,"Trying to Orange Pill an Older Relative by Giving a Formal PresentationHi Bitcoin Team!

I've got an older relative and I want him to increase his bitcoin position to around 5-10% of his portfolio, while making possible for him to sleep at night and ignore the media FUD/ volatility.  He has a small position in Bitcoin rn but he gets annoyed whenever I talk about it.  He's funny because he tells me I'm obsessed when I bring it up. So I don't bring it up, and then he brings it up!

I told him that I'd like to just have an in-depth conversation about it in a few days and then after that, we can shelf the conversation entirely.

So here's where you come in! I'd like to prepare some google slides that I can present to him formally and when I make them, I'd be happy to share them here for your use as well.

I need links to short video clips from influential people, quotes, and links to important charts. (Money supply and other charts about the financial system/ no TA, although I'll explain S2F to him)  


This is the structure I'm imagining right now, which I'm hoping to abridge into a 20-30 minute presentation:  


1) Quick overview of the financial crisis from a macro perspective. Just the main points, skipping over stuff he already knows.

2) What is QE?

3) How this was a backdrop for Bitcoin to be created

4) A brief overview of Satoshi, Cypherpunks, and the Sound Money protocol/ how it works. (the ledger, the halving cycle, mining, the difficulty adjustment, cryptography, and fully validating nodes)  I don't want to go to deep into any of this, so I'll probably make some comparisons to things he can understand and just scratch the surface. He should be left with the idea that this is new technology and pretty exciting stuff.

5) Stock to Flow, what is it and how bitcoin has tracked the price.  I'll tell him about Plan B, the anonymous Dutch institutional investor, which is an interesting story.

5) The interest rates in Europe going negative, what that means, and how we're headed there in the states.

5) Quotes from Billionaires on Bitcoin. I'd like to gather some one-line quips from Ray Dahlio, Stanly Druckenmiller, Paul Tudor Jones.

6) Explaining a Store of Value, the properties of money from Preston Pysh's inteview with Robert Breedlove, and why bitcoin's hard cap and decentralization positions Bitcoin to uniquely be the best store of value humanity has ever created.

6) The best short (around a minute) Michael Saylor Video Clip. After which, I will explain that Michael Saylor is a MIT Alum, Billionaire CEO/ early investor in Apple, who understands networks and networks effects on a master-class level.  I will tell him about Michael Saylor's position in Bitcoin on his company's balance sheet, how he doubled down during the recent dip, and what he's doing to bring in the institutional investors.

7) A short clip of Jack Dorsey's interview at the Bitcoin Conference. ""absolutely, its the only way out""

8) A short clip of Chamath Palahaptiya calling Bitcoin ""shmuck insurance"" on the news.

9) Energy FUD and why Bitcoin incentivizes clean, cheap energy. Changing the bird's eye perspective on energy.

10) Bitcoin in El Salvador, the lightning network, and a brief explanation of Bitcoin's game theory. I might tack on the reasons that I don't like ETH and why altcoins are irrelevant for him. Quick explanation of layered money.

11) I'll maybe close it with the idea that bitcoin is a speculative asset class, but it is also a growing network, with the intrinsic value being the network itself.  I'll explain that just like a Microsoft words utility is to help you make documents, Bitcoin's utility is:

Sound Money without Centralized Manipulation

Store of Value

Transfer of Value/ Settlement

Smart Contracts

Second Layer Network Technology

Financial Sovereignty for the Unbanked (and banked alike)

Access to a growing Asset class without real estate, wall street, or any third parties.

And we're barely scratching the surface.

  


&amp;#x200B;

  
Anything you think I missed from a deep orange pill perspective?  Anything you think I should skip? and finally, please link any convincing charts, video clips, or websites that might help me make this?  


Just to clarify, I'm not trying to make y'all do the research work for me, but I'd like to make an awesome short presentation and I know that your perspective will help me craft this into a banger.  Maybe I'll even turn this into an Orange pill vid when all is said and done and I'll happily share the google sheets."

Are you aware that the adoption of bitcoin as a currency means that at some point (since a currency is generally used to transmit the information for some exchange of value) you are actually eligible to an equal amount of value to the amount of bitcoin you possess? 

Whatever inflation can happen with $ or € is nothing compared to when some of the whales starts to spend their bitcoin. Martin Shkrelis overpriced drugs are harmless compared to this leverage the bitcoin industry has.

I see bitcoin (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) dead in the water if it isn't correlated to any existing distribution of value of the whole market or some part of market. Bitcoin is to small right now to really see that effect but the moment some countries have adopted bitcoin as a currency you guys have to be very responsible spenders if you don't want to be responsible for an upcoming crisis! (I'm just guessing that almost none of you whales has any participation in any real world economic endeavor proportionally to the amount of bitcoin you possess.) Thus the more bitcoin is spread the more there will be resistance in adopting it.

Disregarding the already scammy vibes of a giveaway like this, I set up a cash app account and entered. A little more than an hour later I received a notification that I had ‘received’ $10 worth of btc(0.0028591). So I think, ‘cool, let me go ahead and add those stats to my actual wallet. I go through the additional verification steps required for withdrawal, only to discover that the minimum amount for withdrawal is 0.001 btc. So in order to actually withdraw the giveaway sats I would be forced to purchase an additional .00071409(about $25). 

Much disappoint. It’s not a giveaway if you can’t actually take possession of the thing being ‘given’ without purchasing something. Not your keys, yadda yadda. They should have just framed it as a discount/limited time only promotion. “Buy ____ amount of bitcoin and get an additional $10 worth free” or whatever. Rant over."

1) there is no way to crack down on individual ones: you make ASICs illegal - you’ll have to make GPUs (and eventually CPUs) illegal.

2) it ironically solves claimed environmental problems as well as potential problems with global semiconductors supply

3) even if governments themselves take over mining in order to censor transactions - we can always change hash function (imposing huge losses on them rendering all ASICs useless), which is what I’m pretty sure they quite aware of

Shouldn’t it be all good news? Even banning banks from dealing with crypto is good - they would just turn Btc into glorified stock.

The only problem we have left is media bought out by speculators (buy media - short - repeat) and ProofOfStake-networks supporting “toxic mining” narrative."

At least a few years back , biggest problem for Bitcoin was transaction speed. It could take days to validate transactions at the height of 2017 madness. 

Has the above problem now been solved? If only partially solved, then what % are we talking about now, 50%, 80% or 20%? As I understand the Lightning Network has been implemented more than a year ago by now. Is Bitcoin transfer speed now competitive with Visa or we are still far away from that point? Because the way I see it, if transaction speed problem has been solved then the only issue remaining for Bitcoin adoption is energy use and government regulation (only two out of three remain). 

This is an honest question and I will be very very grateful for any information you could provide on this guys."

Bershire Hathaway is currently at $415,600 per share and is sitting on a mountain of rapidly self destructing fiat that they can't deploy because Buffet is out to lunch and his political influence is weakening as he ages and is surpassed by the younger more intelligent generation.

a) Short first
b) Coordinate dump later

If so, the ethos of shorting out a known and targeted entity (e.g. hedge funds) through short squeezing (i.e. GME, AMC) can be a viable play here.

Being a native Spanish speaker I've been following local media. The FUD against Bitcoin is really strong.

Bukele is widelly being made fun of for saying ""Every business has to accept Bitcoin but doesn't have to receive it"" This is obviously correct, as merchants have the choice to instantly get their payment converted to dollar, but taken out of context is a great line for haters and propaganda makers.

The 30$ dollar airdrop is being criticized because you need to use the government app to get it (Which has id + facial recognition KYC)... ""what will they do with our data?"" Even if is completely optional and you can use any LN app you like. At the same time they criticize Bitcoin because it will suit criminals and money laundry... I just don't get it.

I am really intrigued how this will play out. Only 90 days of implementation and education are really optimistic and I can understand the fear of those in El Salvador who have no idea how BTC works and what it is. I really wish this does not backfire on BTC.

1624656660,Bitcoin,"Some of you need to read this.There is currently a BIG effort by governments (specially China and the USA) to try to kill or severly hamper BTC and other forms of Crypto.

Taking the money printing power away from them in currency and a store of value that is decentralized, unhackable, fast, reliable and universally accepted spells really bad news for them.

The current price drops are prodcuts of this (there are already many posts detailingf the massive shorts). We will see MANY more attacks in th efuture and a whole lot of FUD. (my ""classic"" financial news sources and analyses have been full of it the last week when they would't even acknowledge it's existence before).

If you put more money into it that you require for your daily life for the next 6 months or more, it's gonna be pretty rough. Reconsider just putting in what you want to save for HODLing for 2+ years.

Remember 1 BTC =1 BTC. If you believe BTC will hold it's value in the long run, then just forget about it. In 5 years you can check back and find you can afford a whole lot.

The news always focuses on the negative aspects for BTC but governments (specially CHina) has never liked Bitcoin.

The reality is:

* BTC is now legal tender in some countries with more to come.
* Financial institutions have invested in BTC.
* There is a much wider awareness of the ""common folk"" of what BTC is and they want to get into it but fear they are ""too late"" (spoiler, they're not).
* Companies are starting to buy BTC and other Crypto (mainly ETH) to hold as an investment and crucially as a store of cvalue to hedge against hgeavy rising inflation.
* INflation in the world is going to unseen levels in many couuntries due to so much printing and the effect of the USD on other currencies will create a domino printing effect. They can and will continue to print a LOT of money while BTC is only a finite amount hich is known to all.
* We are still at least 2 and a half years away from the next halving (which will increase the value even more).
* China banning mining is great news for everyone but the chinese miners.
* No one person or group has control of BTC supply (no one can create more).
* It has broken it's biggest obstacle: People have given faith and value to BTC in spite of it being ""just code"" and not a physical token created by a bank. The acceptance of BTC will not recede, it will only gain in time.

My point is: If you understand and think about it rationally, BTC has surpassed all the previous attempts and the facts are there of it's continued growth, acceptance and use. The previos gains in the year were proof of it and it will skyrocket once the conditions are set for it. If you can HODL for what you have, you will have done your future self an incredible favor, but don't invest what you need or will need in your daily life as that creates a lot of anxiety which makes people check like crazy and suffer a dip to 35,000 without realizing the valu it had just a year prior."

I am interested to know wether you invest a certain percentage of your pay each month? Do you go in hard when buying the dip? Do you just buy when you can? Is your portfolio very Bitcoin heavy? Etc.

I will be receiving £20k soon for the sale of some land and hoping to put some of that in to Bitcoin. I must admit I will be buying some more physical silver too. I also plan to take £25k out of my Vanguard Lifestrategy100 account.

Hello ,

I've created this project inspired by the work of Einstein , Satoshi Nakamoto and the movie In time . a combination of a meme and a serious project to make Time a universal currency.

Official Time on mainnet : [https://time.market](https://www.time.market/)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/goznsg1ifp771.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad5624847b4f96d50933238bea847d9ee1889d7b

What is $TIME?

Inspired by the movie ""In Time"" , Time has become the universal currency, transferred directly between people or stored in ""time capsules"" ( wallets )

How ?

Time-keepers distribute TIME Every one elapsed day ( 86400 sec ).

They are incentivized by every second after a day expires. It's not about how much resources they use to mine but by how much incentive they may lose

Once the Time is distributed, the crowd can buy it from the Time Bank ( the time source ) then traded in secondary markets."

Given the current positive trends regarding Bitcoin (institutions, financial elites and governments of small countries warming up to it) despite the China and Elon nonsense, I and many others project the adoption/desirability of Bitcoin as well as the (fiat) price of 1 Bitcoin to skyrocket within the next 5-10 years. By that point, you will have entered a small elite of super wealthy individuals who got there because they took a risk today; owning 1 BTC will put you in not be in the top 1% financially, but top 0.1%. 

It's only a matter of time before the current financial system (which is currently creaking off of the legacy reputation of the United States and US Dollar) grinds to a halt during this crisis period and we have to reinvent it entirely. I imagine the reinvention of the financial system will be one based on a digital currency that is limited in quantity and that no single government controls, with Bitcoin being the prime candidate.

We want new people interested in BTC and crypto and if they all believe this is going to dip, they won’t enter the market and…. The correction/dip will continue. We need buying pressure, not selling. Wouldn’t you rather have everyone going in now, in the low-to-mid $30,000s and just keep buying as it continues to stay sideways or go up? When we start hitting all-time highs, are you really going to care that you bought at $25k vs $30k?

$65k to $30k is the dip. Start buying and stop talking about the hypothetical lower price you’re going to buy at. Some broken record advice… DCA. Invest 1/52nd of what you want to invest in total every week. And if that dip comes that you’ve been waiting for… stop the DCA strategy and and back up the truck to buy as much as you want.

Some people do leverage trading, as in used borrowed money in the hopes of amplifying their returns. As a collateral they must own at least 30% of the asset. This is called margin trading and some platforms can charge 6% interest. When the price of bitcoin goes down significantly and the borrower has no money or feels pressured, the borrower then has to sell all of their bitcoin.

Massive liquidations can happen due to large leverage tradings. In that same process, people who buy too high stand to lose over 50-60% of their money in a period of a week."

1624736883,Bitcoin,"Thoughts about market environmentWe are in a bear market and it will probably take a few rocky months until we see a rally, maybe towards the end of the year. 

Reasons: (1) Many people are shifting from saving to consuming as the pandemic is slowing down and life as we knew it is coming back. (2) China banning itself from Bitcoin is a big deal. If you believe that the value of Bitcoin is strongly related to the number of users and the network effect, a ban of 1.5bn users means that the value of Bitcoin has to decrease. (3) China banning miners is also a big deal. Less miners means that the hashrate/difficulty decreases and the network becomes less secure, therefore decreasing its value. (4) The narrative of this bull market was institutional investors and the “wall of money” coming in, but the ESG component of Bitcoin was underestimated.

I think China’s ban of BTC is ultimately a strategic move to position the digital yuan as the new world reserve currency. We might see a new digital “cold war” with Bitcoin as reserve currency of the free world and  government CDBCs in autocratic regimes.

I’m still very bullish on BTC and the crypto market, but it could take a while until the market recovers. Mining will move to US and other locations and will be cleaner, settling up for a new bull run. History has shown that Bitcoin always comes back stronger."

on  December 22, 2020, I mistakenly deleted the Google Authenticator app from my phone and couldn't recover it, and unfortunately, I lost my Blockchain Exchange account 2Fa 

when I realized that, I immediately requested blockchain to reset my 2Fa

they said you can reset it with your 2Fa backup code or verifying yourself by taking a photo from yourself holding these informations:  

1. Today's date;
2. Today's BTC price;
3. A handwritten text ""*2FA reset for the Blockchain.com Exchange"";*
4. Email Address registered to your Blockchain Exchange account;
5. Your full name, address and date of birth.

Since I didn't have my 2fa back up I was forced to verify myself.

In summary, I end up sending my information and verify myself but there was a problem, some of my information when signing up was fake because blockchain wasn't supporting my country 

but on January 13, 2021, they ended up accepting my verification and they answered me with this message :

so after about 2 months I create a follow-up to my previous request and asked them to give me an estimated time but they set my request to solved with no answer

I created few more follow-up requests but the same thing was happening until I tried to do it once more after 2 months, but this time this is what they said :

I was so confused and I was like what does that have to do with my problem I don't know what they were talking about and at the same time I realized my blockchain exchange account is deleted cause when I was trying to sign in it tells me to sign up and an account with this email doesn't exist I tell the new support the whole story again but after about 5 months they still haven't answered me and my request is still open.

after all that and a few months later I create a follow-up to my first request again, first time I explain everything again but all they do was setting my request to SOLVED  with no answer did the same thing again after few months but all I get was a SOLVED request with no message and now its been almost 8 months and still haven't got even an answer.

hope they even hear me out or people in here help me."

In 2020, your $1,000 is actually worth $1,040.12 in 2021 money due to the 4.99% inflation. This is calculated by BLS and uses the consumer price index. 

To put in a 20 year context, your $1,000 back in 2000 has the same buying power of $1,563.27 today. But if you left it in the bank and collected a tiny interest over time, your actual money has depreciated over the decades. For other countries like the UK, their inflation is actually worse. £1,000.00 in 2000 would be equivalent to £1,726.63 in 2021. 

Rather than having your fiat currency in the bank, wouldn't it make more sense just to store it in bitcoin? For people planning on retiring for the next 20 years, aren't you worried about the rapid inflation in your currency? Typically the US experiences a 2.5% inflation every year but with this year it has risen to 4.99%."

This can be described as a way which - supposedly - allows you to access memories of your past life/lives (implying reincarnation).

I am scientifically minded but I also accept that there is so much we don't know about the very nature of ourselves and the universe in which we happen to live.

So, I was thinking: let's suppose for a moment that reincarnation -  or something similar - is real. What would that imply?

Being bitcoin what it is - an asset which you fully own by simply 'knowing' something (private-key / seed) - then bitcoin would also be the only asset that you can easily 'leave to yourself' in your next life/lives.

You would 'just' need to see/remember the seed (again), for example with the help of spiritual regression.

Thinking about other kind of assets, it would be extremely difficult to (re)acquire them in your next life, because it would be almost impossible to prove your 'property rights' on them (and everything would have been inherited by your 'old' relatives).

Bitcoin is different: knowing the seed is enough 'proof' (but this can work only if you didn't leave the seed to your relatives).

Well, that would be next-level holding!"

If this is true, and BTC someday becomes the world's reserve currency, replacing the 200 trillion dollars of currency in circulation around the world, that would imply that the final value of one BTC could be as much as around 10 million dollars, nominally speaking, in today's money.

Which would make each sat worth about a dime.

And of course the shrinkage, while I'm sure it's slowed dramatically as BTC has increased in value, hasn't stopped altogether. And even after it arrives at its final destination, and even if that destination is 10 million usd, it won't stop even then. Even if BTC replaces all other currency, the deflation, although slowed, will never stop.

Those are kind of sobering thoughts. And that's also assuming that its evolution from this point forward is smooth. While I'm very optimistic about BTC's ultimate success, I think a big part of that success will be surviving yet another global financial crisis, which I believe will be far worse than the first one. I believe BTC could suffer horribly in the short term during such an event, but recover dramatically when hyperinflation of fiat currencies finally sets in. I could easily see a scenario in which a global financial crash brought BTC to its knees, and cause the world to think it had failed. In such an event, we could see key loss like never before, even worse than the development phase when people took few precautions to protect them.

So ultimately it's anyone's guess how much value a single BTC could have. But it would seem that 10 million in today's dollars is a good conservative estimate, in the event that it eventually became the universal reserve for the world.

I write this as a word of encouragement, but also as one of warning. Along with the standard advice of not investing more than you're willing to lose, I would add to that, if such a time comes when people think BTC is dead, that may be your signal to guard those keys more tightly than ever before. Even if it returns to .10 per BTC, you continue to protect that BTC as if it were worth 10 million, because if hyperinflation kicks in, it could literally go from .10 to 10 million dollars in only a few short months."

1624825145,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, daily hash rate, future energy consumption and the lightning networkDear knowledgable bitcoiners,  


I love simulation modelling, and I've been playing around with a model to get a better understanding of Bitcoin and its energy consumption. Basically, I used this scientific paper as a starting point: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09212). I then added some small components to simulate historical energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, and compared my results to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ([https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption](https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption)).   


Here are the historical simulation results (simulation starting at 9th of july 2016  and running in days):   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to early june 2021 ](https://preview.redd.it/hlr3gw6r7v771.jpg?width=478&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=64103052c843370a0099c9145900c289e6706911)

I then started playing around a little. I ran a simulation going about 20 years ahead while assuming the following:  
\- Daily number of transactions will remain constant at 250 k per day  
\- Transaction fee per transaction remain constant at todays level (measured in BTC)  
\- The energy efficiency of mining hardware also stays constant at todays level  
\- The electricity prices stay constant at todays level  
\- The price of bitcoin increases 5% per year.   


This is what I got:   


[Bitcoin Energy Consumption from 9th of july 2016 to somewhere about june 2041](https://preview.redd.it/8xl8wpyf8v771.jpg?width=489&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90a3a518313080a8d9d31609e79687a433f20f89)

  
I then realized that the miners are mostly incentivized by the built-in subsidy right now. In fact, my model estimates that bitcoin miners would only consume about 15 TWH per year if it wasnt for the built-in subsidiy. Due to the halving events, the incentives for mining will go down over time following the next halving as long as the bitcoin price does not increase by more than 50% per 4-ish year period.  At least according to my model... 

Having realized that, I came to think about the lightning network. Someone told me that the lightning network will basically bundle a lot of transactions such that it becomes only one transaction on the network. This had me wondering, what will happen to the future hash rate if LN bundle a lot of transactions in one transaction, and the block rewards go down significantly? Won't it become much less profitable with mining? Will the network still be secure in a setting where the hash rate is very low?   


All the best,

1624823950,Bitcoin,"Am I 100% doing this Coldcard thing right?Upon receiving it, I updated and verified the firmware, and it has been 100% airgapped ever since. I use a 9v battery to power it, have not plugged it into a computer, and it hasn't had an SD card since the firmware update.

It's for long term storage and is to remain 100% airgapped. Bitcoin goes in and doesn't come back out again until time to buy moon lambo.

After updating the firmware, I generated test wallets by throwing dice, and verified them using the python script from their website. After being confident that it was faithfully encrypting the dice throws, I generated my actual seed, which I of course didn't verify, but backed up by engraving the 24 word seed on stainless steel.

I then sent a thousand in BTC to the first address listed in the address explorer on the device, after which I wiped the seed and restored it using the backup I had engraved, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes recording it. The restored wallet showed the same receive addresses in the address explorer.

I'm now sending small amounts to subsequent addresses in the address explorer, in order.

The only thing I haven't done is test sending BTC out of the wallet, since that would require breaking my airgap. Which leads to my main question.

Are there any possible mistakes, errors in firmware, etc. at this point that could still mean losing the BTC I send to this wallet? Or am I 100% good to go and have nothing to worry about?"

1624821829,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin critisismI look for criticism and I am pro bitcoin, I have to say its hard to
find proper arguments against bitcoin on this reddit. I see manly
negative news articles about some regulation and other news that seem
bad for btc. But no fundamental discussion. What I found so far are these:

1) Price is to volatile, or It has no guaranteed value and it's a bubble
2) It's not accepted yet and you can't pay in most shops
3) It faces harsh drawbacks from government/the people who do not want
to give away their power of printing money, so they will somehow stop it.

4) There are thousands of coins out there = inflation. I deem that not
to be true since every POW system that has a smaller hashrate that
bitcoin is theoretically ""hackable"" by the hashingpower provided by the
btc miners, plus compare the hashing power to any other network or
supercomputer in the world, do the math yourself, it's not that hard)


I myself find some aspects not good, like that it will - if it succeeds - change or party crash the economy. Like there is not so much incentive to spend the money or btc now when (in btc terms) there is almost no Inflation. (Which in my opinion would make a positive impact on the enviroment since people won't waste their money on useless and short-lived products)
The environmental standpoint of course, but all the energy goes directly into the cryptographic security and the immutability btc offers (not security in terms of $ - that's just determined by supply and demand) so it makes it more resilient to being hacked wich ich almost impossible.
It's just like an unbiased accounting system in my eyes. Though you have to compare it to the traditional banking system with all those buildings and ATMs running around the clock and whatever else the banking system needs.

I would love to hear some constructive criticism, for me personally it seems like a system that will (at what price however, probably going up) continue to exist."

That same house is now $1.8 million after property values in that area skyrocketed. During the early 80s, the minimum wage in San Francisco was $2.50. I've also noticed that the cars in my area are very expensive, new vehicles are now priced at 27,000-39,000. These are new Kias, Hondas and Toyotas in San Francisco dealerships. Five years ago, prices for these same vehicles ranged from 18,000 to 26,000. 

The US dollar annual inflation rate is now 5%. I know that the US dollar is still better than other countries but the cost of living has risen and the wages haven't climbed very much. With bitcoin, I see my dollar's worth appreciating. I trust in bitcoin, despite its market volatility, its overall value seems to be climbing every year. At the same time, I'm concerned that its value could be shot down by regulators and central bank authorities that see it as public enemy #1."

I stopped buying cigars and cigarettes by doing this I slowed my aging curve and improved my health and I smell better as well. I stopped going out Friday nights and or Saturday nights and stayed home and cooked healthy foods and educated myself. I started thinking about any purchase I made asking myself do I really need this how will it improve my life. I stopped buying over priced sneakers all the time. I stopped buying full price designer cloths and looked for deals, I stopped jumping into trendy fads, I stopped paying for cable tv and I upgraded my internet to stream tv instead. I started changing my mindset. I began to believing that spending everything I earn today is nothing more then a poor man's mind set and that saving my energy in bitcoin and other stores of value is a rich man's mind set. It is not what you make it is what you spend. Bitcoin is the way we will all change the world. It is not our purpose to change the world it is our desire to create a better, stronger and harder system where we can save our energy and our time to use at a later time.

Hope you find it interesting and a nice addition to your own confirmation bias as to why Bitcoin is and will be lifechanging. Also, thank you for reading.

# First, a couple of caviats;

\- I am not a Bitcoin OG. I didn't know about it in 2013. I hated it in 2017. I FOMOed in 2018. I was surprised in 2020. And I love and understand it in 2021.

\- I am not a financial advisor, and I am speaking on behalf of the company I own which employs just south of 20 people.

\- We don't have a massive treasury and are inexperienced as a company investing in assets and other instruments

\- English is not my mother tongue, so bear with me.

\- Fuck you Elon.

In this piece I'll do my best and explain from a small corporate perspective why accumulating Bitcoin became part of the corporate strategy and unanimously accepted by the general assembly.

# Next, some background to who we are as a company

I founded the marketing agency back in 2017 and we quickly hired alot of people and attracted great clients. Our work is a combination of video production, copywriting, graphic design, web, podcast and everything social media. Basically, we are a marketing department that our clients ""subscribe"" to for 12 months with certain limitations for a fixed price. Our projected revenue 2021 EOY is about 2,5M USD.

We are known for being provacative, experimental and the ""go-to-place"" for small B2B companies to jumpstart their marketing game.

Again, our business model is not very scalable. It's human trafficking (it's a joke!!!) - we need one guy or gal to do some work, and that work can only be done so many times in a day. If we want to do more of that work, we need to hire a new guy or gal and so on. And if you don't have BCG or McKinsey in your logo - the ability to scale on premium price is very difficult as well. The avarage profit margin in Norway in our industry is about 3-4%. Eeeew. The ""only"" way to make big buck with this kind of business model is either scale massively on people, price or both. The cost that makes up about 85% of the total, is rent for office space and labour cost, so it requires alot to make that happen. It's very risky to scale an agency business with people if you don't have alot of cash on hand - which we don't have.

We've been in business like I said since 2017 and so far we have not made a meaningful profit yet. We have OK salaries, but that's it. We are smart, creative and driven people - so the salary, even though it is OK, it is not extremely good. And we do want to create a company that can pay out significant dividends to make up for the struggle of building, running and owning a company. With current model, that seems to be a stretch medium-term.

# The Pandemic Gave Perspective On Things

Like most other places, within a week from March 9th to March 12th of 2020, the semantics went from ""yeye, I don't care"", to; ""OMFG"". It literally turned most of our business upside down and was a really chaotic experience. The unthinkable paradox happened; everyone wanted to sell something, but none wanted to buy anything. Except fucking toilet paper.

Marketing, and especially external marketing consultants, is not business critical to everyone, maybe even anyone, during a world crisis. And obviously we faced a lot of pushback from our clients. So we are grateful that most stayed with us, but some left. Leaving our business extremely volnurable as we don't have the liquidity to simply shut down.

A few months in during the pandemic, my partner told me: ""Dude, Bitcoin just hit 30k"". We had been speculating somewhat back in 2017 and found crypto to be somewhat interesting, but at the same time a piece of shit idea. And I remember thinking to myself that we were going to see another meltdown like never before with crypto. But, then I started reading about it. I read about Michael Saylor, Tesla's purchase, banks recruiting experts, ETF's trying to be accepted, Queen Cathie Woods, white papers, Cointelegraph, Bitcoin Magazine and so on. Not only that, but our very own Kjell Inge Røkke (one of Norway's wealthiest) just put 60 million dollars in it and started a crypto company.

I am not the smartest guy in the crypto room, but these guys are - and now I was on my journey of juggling a struggling company during the pandemic, firing bad people and also putting in the first 1000 hours of understanding Bitcoin, the money system and how this will be adopted as a revolutionary technology 5-10 years from now.

And then I realized...

# Why Bitcoin Is Not A Risky Bet (for us)

I've done several bad hires - actually a couple to many because of my own naivity. During the worst period of corona last year we knew that we had 4 bad hires in our organization. That is pretty significant as we were only 15 employees at the time.

This might be a controversial line, but hiring **bad** people is a zero-sum game in which the employee is the winner and the employer is the loser. A bad hire is the true Rat Poison Squared as the faggot would say.

Now, most of you I assume live in the US and I live in Norway. Two completely different hiring/firing laws. In Norway, you simply can't fire someone ""just because"". Making the bad hire outcome even worse, since the process of firing someone that don't create any value for the company is a tedious process - time consuming, energy draining, lawyer fees and always a ""settlement package"" including minimum 3 months of salary. I know of entrepreneur peers that simply went bankrupt because of a few bad hires early on that just dragged the process so long that the company didn't have any liquidity left. And yes, I agree that the employer has a responsibility of not making those mistakes. But, come on bro.

The point I'm trying to make here is that if you have made a bad hire; it is like watching your stock go from whatever price to 0. It literally is a 100% loss. And the chances of getting even the slightest amount of value from a bad hire is also near 0%. Bad hire bad. Good hire good.

So I thought to myself at first in winter 2021. What if we trim our agency to become a truly premium business, work on upskilling people, and invest in what we already have and add a few seniors to our team, and then re-invest the hypotethically cost of bad hires in Bitcoin? Either we double in size and go from about 20 people to 40 and making 5M revenue with 10% margin and along the way waste a shit ton of money on bad hires. Because, trust me, bad hires comes with volume in recruiting. There is no way past it.

Or we invest and accumulate Bitcoin and dream about a 10x return within the next 4-5 years with alot less company risk, governance, stress and hazzle. I liked the latter idea so much that I wanted to pursue it as a core strategy for our company and change my role from being just a ""CEO"" to Master of Coin. A fun ego boost as well.

I needed to convince the group of equity partners and also the small board we have. And I'd like to share with you guys how I did it.

1624909592,Bitcoin,"How much energy does bitcoin use?How much electricity does bitcoin consume globally? The answer is important not only for the health of the planet, but also for the currency’s value.

Researchers start by looking at the bitcoin network’s daily “hashrate”—i.e., how quickly computers on the network can perform calculations. Then they make some assumptions about the computer equipment most miners are using.1 Throw in an estimate of average electricity prices and the latest price for bitcoin, and you can get an accurate, if imprecise, estimate of electricity consumption. The most reputable such estimate comes from the University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, according to which the global bitcoin network currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of 23 coal-fired power plants, or close to what is consumed by the nation of Finland."

Why aren't multi-millionaires/billionaires buying up Bitcoins? (I'm sure they are).

(there are a million household who have at least $10,000,000).

If I had that much wealth, wouldn't I just start accumulating Bitcoin (yes I know there is risk, but let's be real, seems that the sentiment of Bitcoin is bullish as long as you HODL long-term 10-30-100 years).

I have been reading that 'institutions' or 'big whales' are jumping on.

1624908676,Bitcoin,"Bitcoiners need to be more tolerant of opposing views, no matter how unpopular they may be.I consider myself an open-minded person who believes in innovation that will improve the world and make it a better place. I think the poor and underprivileged deserve a chance to improve their lives and I am not opposed to helping them out.  However, I am against Bitcoin because it's obviously a scam. 

Eventhough I don't really know how it works or how to use it, I have the feeling that it will not improve the world or make it a better place.  I think I know what it is enough to judge it without needing to learn about it because the name sounds simple. 

It's a coin on the internet. 

Eventhough I will never pretend to know how physics, neuroscience or chemistry work, I know how bitcoin works without needing to learn about it.  Eventhough I have no experience with decentralized systems, cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, or money itself, I have enough experience with scams and empty promises to know that Bitcoin is a scam.  

I do think I am smarter than most people. Most people don't believe in Bitcoin. I , like 99% of the population, think Bitcoin is a scam and only morons would buy it. Because we are smart, we won't get scammed.  

We don't need Bitcoin because it is not backed by anything. My money is backed by a government. I can trust my government because all governments are trustworthy and never print out too much money that will devalue our currency. 

This is why house prices have been the same for the past 100 years, and are affordable for everyone. This is how my parents bought this house for us 50 years ago. Now if we sell it, we can make half a million dollars. This is thanks to the government. 

Bitcoin is backed by what? It's backed by nothing. There is no government, no bank, no institution or company behind it. It's just a bunch of computers. Computers are untrustworthy. You can't trust a computer. Computers crash. They malfunction. You can trust the government because people are more trustworthy and uncorruptable.

And don't even mention the fossil fuels used by Bitcoin itself. This is just ridiculous. I don't want to be part of that. I don't want to contribute to destroying the planet. I consider myself a person who cares and protects the planet that's why I only use electric cars and eat organic. 

Eventhough I understand poor people can't afford anything because their savings get devalued every year, I think their problems will be solved once they get a real job and work harder. Then they can retire in the house their parents bought them and contribute to our cause by getting their own electric cars.

Why do we even need to waste so much energy on Bitcoin when we have banks? Banks don't use up fossil fuels. 

I have the feeling that the Bitcoin community is just full of greedy people who only care about making money. In my opinion, and in the opinion of almost everyone I know, only greedy people would buy something like that.

I don't have any experience. And I don't care about Bitcoin. It's irrelevant to my life. I won't use it and I don't want to use it."

1624907155,Bitcoin,"BTC Showing 2 Bullish SignalsThere are two very important patterns that are playing out in the [Bitcoin chart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfOaHzcJ9IM). Lets take a closer look at these patterns and identify what they mean for the Bitcoin price.

Firstly, on the Bitcoin 1 day chart, we see a falling wedge pattern getting formed. As we know the falling wedge is a bullish pattern. Yesterday, we broke above the falling wedge and today we are treating the top line of the wedge as a support. If we can confirm it as a support, the target for Bitcoin will be approximately $40,000. But before reaching $40K, there are a lot of resistances. The first resistance is at the level of $35,000 which has been acting as a resistance for the past few days. If we break above the $35k, then the 20 day simple moving average which is at $35, 750 will act as a string resistance. If we cross above that, then the 50 day simple moving average which is at $38k approximately will be the next hurdle before reaching $40K. And once we reach $40K, the 200 day Simple moving average will be the strongest resistance.

Secondly, on the Bitcoin 4 hours chart, we see a double bottom pattern getting formed which is also a bullish pattern. The neck line for this pattern is close to $35,500 level. If we break above it, then our target could be $40,000. But, as mentioned earlier there are several resistances before we reach $40K.

Lastly, on the Bitcoin Monthly chart, we notice that the level of $30,112 is a very critical support and breaking below it can take Bitcoin price to about $20,000. So, its very important that we close this month above the aforementioned price."

The main difference with this case is that Ricardo Salinas Pliego actually believes that BTC is a real equivalent of gold, and that fiat currencies in fact are a fraud.

1624905423,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Hashrate Climbs Back Above 100 EH/s, Difficulty Could Drop More Than 20% Next WeekOn Saturday, Bitcoin’s SHA256 hashrate managed to climb back above the 100 exahash per second region after it slid to a low of 91 EH/s three days ago. Meanwhile, in five days the network’s mining difficulty change is approaching and it could see the difficulty drop over 20%.
Statistics show that bitcoin (BTC) miners are processing blocks a lot faster, as the hashrate has improved during the last 48 hours. On June 26, 2021, the network’s hashrate jumped back above the 100 EH/s zone.
The hashrate fell to 91 EH/s on June 23, 2021, following the crackdowns in China stemming from five Chinese provinces with the most recent being Sichuan. Between then and over the last three days, the hashrate has increased 9-13%The next mining difficulty drop is expected to happen in five days and at current processing power, it could drop around 20.57%. At the time of writing, the network’s mining difficulty is 19.93 trillion and the change could bring it to 15.83 trillion next week.
Bitcoin’s mining difficulty is essentially the measurement of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target. When Bitcoin’s hashrate is high, the difficulty will increase, and when the hashrate drops like it did after China’s crackdown, the mining difficulty will drop lower. Therefore making it easier and harder to mine BTC with every fluctuation. Bitcoin’s network difficulty changes every 2,016 blocks or roughly every two weeks.

The top five bitcoin (BTC) mining pools on June 26, 2021, include Antpool, F2pool, Viabtc, Binance Pool, and Poolin. Those five mining pools capture 62.83% of the Bitcoin hashrate, while the rest is processed by 11 known pools and a 7.49% portion of mystery hashrate.
The next difficulty change seems to be pointing toward the largest mining difficulty drop in 2021 thus far. The network did see the largest difficult rise in 2021, with an approximate 21.53% increase, at block height 683,424 on May 13."

I just wanted to see what the overall consensus was on selling Bitcoin. The well-known Bitcoin advocate Mr. Michael Saylor has already stated that you should never sell your Bitcoin and that you should hold onto it for life. He argues that when you sell you're Bitcoin you're taxed, but if you hold onto it you can borrow against the Bitcoin (tax-free) at a decent interest rate. Platforms such as Block Fi offer this type of service. 

What do you guys think about this? If I double my investment during this next bull run it would be tempting not to sell a little bit for liquidity purposes. I do love Bitcoin and the direction it's going so I plan on investing in this for the long term regardless of short-term price fluctuations.

(https://www.census.gov/popclock/) 

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally..."

1625093167,Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and CanadaThere is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

So I recently watched this video where this dude spoke of a 1% profit per day strategy using day trades where he had initially invested $20,000 and kept on making 1% each day and kept reinvesting the profits into the principle and repeated it till he made over $600,000 in the span of like 12-14 months. So once I made the math, if he had continued for over 2 years, he would've made $4+ Million which would've been insane. So, the question is, is this actually doable? If it is, would trades of such high volume be executed in one go? I'm relatively new to the crypto space so if this all sounds dumb, just don't mind lol

I was talking to someone on Telegram and he couldn't answer all my questions, so he referred me here and said the community is very open and willing to help and answer questions, so here I go!

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

1625077332,Bitcoin,"Deflation: the real reason it's good for youtl;dr: No matter who you are, deflation can be good for you. But there are some misleading misconceptions.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!"

1625077018,Bitcoin,"Is Bitcoin better than Fiat?
For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind. This brings a whole new era of financial sovereignty as we know it.

The average family size is 3.15 people
(https://www.statista.com/statistics/183657/average-size-of-a-family-in-the-us/) 

The average savings per family is $49,555.00 
(https://usdebtclock.org) 

With the #'s above, the total savings by US citizens, is $5.23T 

Now do this same analysis for all nations whose citizens have access to trading on the blockchain, and you will get the total (possible) value for BTC, assuming all other variables go unchanged. For example, it assumes people don't change the amount they invest vs spend vs save. Another assumption is that people only view it as a store of value and not an ""investment"" ( which won't be the case until after BTC's price has been fully discovered, until then it will be viewed as an investment. After price discovery then it will become a stable store of value... or savings). And I know all these variables could/will change in the future, but I'm not going to discuss the future anymore, just a snapshot of today's BTC value.

The debate is how much of people's savings would/should be allocated to BTC. I know a lot of people would argue 100%. But I think that's unrealistic, and while it would be ""statistically significant(ly)"" better than USD over the long term, I believe Hard Assets such as Farmland, Potable Water Rights/Access &amp; PM's will play a much bigger part in people's savings portfolios, especially as the younger generations continue researching, learning and challenging the Boomer way of life... I believe this portfolio balance will return, because throughout history, it's always been the case until the 1920/30's when the Great Depression hit, then the USD was removed from the gold standard and became fiat, followed soon thereafter by high risk high reward from investing the fiat in the stock market. People really began to lose sight of what's really important, and what assets you really want to have beneath you when you fall down, or better yet, when a nation or global economy starts falling down... getting back to BTC, I'd say a reasonable assumption is 10-25% of savings is in BTC, putting BTC total value at $523B-1.3T, in the US alone. 

Now I know a lot of people are going to think the best response to this post is to argue my 10-25% savings in BTC comment, but really, it's not worth debating, until someone can come up with the total amount of savings globally..."

1625093167,Bitcoin,"Fun free mobile game that pays you in BTC, plays similar to Pokemon Go! Only in US and CanadaThere is a game that is currently in beta for residents of US/Canada named **Coin Hunt**  that is a geo-location game, like Pokemon Go, except you get paid to  hunt and you are encouraged to grow your community! The founder of this  game is the CEO of a popular cryptocurrency exchange named Bittrex. The  game also gets updates/events frequently, usually every couple weeks.  What I really like about this game is that you aren't really pushed to  leave your house everyday unless you want to overachieve on your  earnings, it is perfectly fine to stay home because there is passive  income in this game! For example, you basically earn about atleast $1 a day for just checking in to your home base in the game. Tens of  thousands of users are currently playing, and the most dedicated people  have earned maybe a thousand a month. I recommend treating it as a  marathon rather than a sprint though!

**Here is a link if you are interested in playing:** [https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT](https://coinhunt.gsc.im/Jzw4NSO6RT)

*Note: There is a Canada Day and July 4th event coming up with a free exclusive costume, don't miss it!*

**What do you do in the game?**  Since this is a geo-location based game, you have to go outside and  move around and the app will follow your position on the map. The two  things you'll find on your map is either a blue key or a coloured vault.  The colour of the key/vault represents its rarity, with the order of  common to most rare being blue-green-yellow-red-purple. You can use 10  blue keys to craft a green key, or 10 green keys to craft a yellow key,  so on. Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

* Download TestFlight ([https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664))
* Download Coinhuntworld ([https://testflight.apple.com/join/2jlFVFVq](https://testflight.apple.com/join/2jlFVFVq)).

Depending on the vault you find out in the world, you'll need the  corresponding coloured key to open it.

Blue keys reward you with $0.10 USD equivalent in BTC/ETH  
Green keys reward  you with $1  
Yellow keys reward you with $10  
Red keys reward you with $100  (Event only)  
Purple keys reward you with $1000 (Event only)

The passive income mainly comes from checking in to the game, which as  mentioned before gives $1 a day, or from vaults that you've placed  around the world. So every user can place a total of 10 vaults anywhere,  and when any other player opens your vault you are rewarded 5% of the  resource. This means every 20 people that open your vault, would be the  same as you going out and opening someones vault (or your own). This  means if you place your vaults in spots that have a lot of user traffic,  you will be rewarded well without even having to leave your house. User  vaults can only be placed in areas where there is something  interesting, which includes stores and businesses, just anything that  isn't your house. Other people cannot place their vaults within 100 metres of your vault. This is why it's important to start playing while  the game is in beta!

**There  are also in-game costumes available in the game, with limited  quantities, which you will be able to sell in the future when the game  is out of beta.**

The game  is great, I really recommend starting as soon as you can! When you first  start the game, you start with 8 blue keys and you just need to find 2  blue keys to craft a green key and build your home base, and you will  unlock all of the essential features of the game.

**For Android:**  The game is available on the google play store, just download the game  and then use the link to open the application and complete the signup with freebies.

**For IOS:**   Apple does not approve beta applications on their store quickly, so  you must use TestFlight to download the application instead.

1625091611,Bitcoin,"1% a day strategy | Does it really work?Hello people of reddit! So I recently watched this video where this dude spoke of a 1% profit per day strategy using day trades where he had initially invested $20,000 and kept on making 1% each day and kept reinvesting the profits into the principle and repeated it till he made over $600,000 in the span of like 12-14 months. So once I made the math, if he had continued for over 2 years, he would've made $4+ Million which would've been insane. So, the question is, is this actually doable? If it is, would trades of such high volume be executed in one go? I'm relatively new to the crypto space so if this all sounds dumb, just don't mind lol

I'd like for someone to change my mind and provide me with information other than ""BTC is the original coin with the best reputation.""

I don't understand the BTC maximalist philosophy, given ETH exists. ETH has been making incredible headway with Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon and similar L2 solutions, as well as the prevalence of DAOs, not to mention DeFi and the possible revolution of the financial industry, and LINK/oracle solutions, as well as The Graph as the central nervous system of the project.

BTC has BCH and BSV, both scams with zero use-case, which has come out of the project. I can't help but to see BTC as MySpace, and ETH as Facebook, which constantly develops and adapts.

I'm aware of BTC's lightning network, but hasn't that become a meme at this point? I own BTC, I want to see it succeed, I just don't understand BTC maximalism and why anyone would say it has more potential than ETH. Thank you."

I believe that the majority wants to see Bitcoin being globally adopted, including myself; I imagine people using it in their daily transactions for food, coffee etc. Lightning payments can tackle the scaling issue and the only thing left for Bitcoin to be used as a currency from the whole world is its mass usage. If the adoption rate increased so would the price's standability. 
 
So, do you set a good example and pay with Bitcoin whenever you're able to or do you prefer not to spend your coins? I'll speak my personal view about this, in my country none of the merchants accept it and I rarely buy some hosting services from the internet. If they do accept it, I'll pay for it, but not because it satisfies me; it's just that I can't with PayPal. I'd prefer paying with PayPal for online services, because I may be scammed if they aren't popular.

1625077332,Bitcoin,"Deflation: the real reason it's good for youtl;dr: No matter who you are, deflation can be good for you. But there are some misleading misconceptions.

When most people talk about deflationary vs inflationary financial instruments, they assume that deflation is good because ""savings are the difference between production and consumption."" Which is true for most people, but NOT MOST WEALTH.

This is because most wealth is held by entities that produce nothing, whether we're talking about ultra wealthy individuals or the state.

This entire logic train that ""savings = production -consumption"" is based on the assumption that the people reaping the profits from production are the people doing the producing, which is seldom the case.

I have run several businesses in my life, large and small, and I've consistently made the most money by paying a small amount of money to other people to produce things, which I then charge other people a large amount of money to buy, then pocketing the difference. Any business owner who has done well will tell you that human capital - the balancing act of hiring the best possible people for the least possible pay - is key to long term success.

And, this is the real hangup. Anyone who has run a business will tell you, you wanna maximize the amount of money you can charge people for the crap you sell. Which means you want wages to be high in general. Which means you want all other businesses to be as generous as possible (thus trapping less wealth).

But pretty much every business I've ever run, the biggest expense is... payroll. So to maximize my own profits, I want to pay my employees as little as I can without sacrificing quality.

This is why we have boom and bust cycles, because it's in my business as a capitalist to horde my wealth and drive down wages at my companies, but it's against my interest for everyone else to do that. And if every single business owner AND employee horded twice as much money as they do now and didn't spend it out into the economy... that's what we call a depression.

This doesn't mean inflationary money is good. Inflation doesn't really affect hording or expending of wealth from the TRULY wealthy all that much BECAUSE WEALTHY PEOPLE NEVER HOLD THEIR WEALTH IN INFLATIONARY FIAT.

Only poor working people keep their money in fiat because they typically work paycheck to paycheck and need immediate access to their money, and they literally can't afford the risk exposure of investment. So deflationary currency will benefit working people a lot, assuming it succeeds, by giving working people a foothold for retirement and other long term building.

Sorry, I know this was a long rant, but the idea that everyone just holding onto all their wealth and stockpiling all their ""profits"" is good for the economy is so backwards. A healthy economy is one where things are moving all the time, a market which is efficiently transferring commodities to people who need them the most. Unfortunately that's pretty much not how things work in our economy, as I explain here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/nnxssa/we_do_the_work_they_take_the_profits_some/

The best most of us can do is try to defend ourselves against these monumental tidal forces of the ultra wealthy accumulating and trapping wealth. Pretending those forces are good for everyone (which they spend a lot of money trying to convince us all is true in their media) is a fast way to financial ruin, which is why we need to be realists and study how things REALLY function so we don't get stomped like most poors (which = most people).

Inflation is REALLY harmful to the majority of working people precisely because most people have great difficulty building savings or buying better assets (most folks in the USA, the richest country on earth, live paycheck to paycheck) and 2-3% inflation is brutal for those folks.

For wealthy people, inflation can be completely avoided. For them, BTC's chief value isn't ever going to be deflation, but PROFITS they can reap through the platform. Totally different game they're playing than most working stiffs, you see. (Again, see my post link above)

So, if you're wealthy... hopefully you already know what you're doing, and it should be easy to hold onto your wealth (by siphoning it up from people who are doing the actual producing - which is literally what we call ""investing"" in the vast majority of cases)

But if you're NOT wealthy, don't try to pretend you are UNTIL you are and you have enough money stockpiled up to make your money do all the work so you don't have to.

I'm expecting a lot of folks to downvote this because it challenges the prominent narrative. I don't care, because the prominent narrative is deliberate disinformation that can lead to bad decisions. Keep stacking sats and best of luck!"

For the first time in history, money is separated from the state. Bitcoin aims to be an alternative to Fiat currencies by providing financial inclusion to anyone, anywhere in the world. A system governed by mathematics and cryptography will put an end to corruption once and for all. The pioneer cryptocurrency can be used globally without limitations thanks to its decentralized model. People can send cross-border payments in minutes without the need for ID verification, background checks, or credit checks of any kind.

now several sources I've encountered state that anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork came into possession of bitcash  'as if from an airdrop' (quote).

now I may be wrong here but that does not sound like BTC holders at the time of the fork had to choose between keeping their BTC holding and receiving equivalent holding in bitcash. rather, it sounds like BTC holders at the time received bitcash holdings on top of their BTC holding at no addition cost. is that what happent? and if so, was it a one time thing which people had to apply for or can anyone who held BTC at the time of the fork still claim some bitcash?

I understand the bull case (I think) but something I have recognised  is the bear case is not as vocalised. Could someone give me a coherent bear case for Bitcoin and how this contrasts to the bull case?

I also have an additional question regarding the bull/bear cycle. Due to the halvening occurring in 2020, are we now expecting a bear run into the later stages of 2021, or is this bear run expected to start in 2022?

1625171544,Bitcoin,"Due Diligence on BTC Trading Bot 

I started trading Bitcoin a month ago I came across a ""trading bot"" ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com)) that seemed to have promising results so I decided to give it a try. The results since then have been…remarkable. I'm not an employee, just a fan so here's my write up.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS A TRADING BOT AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

Crypto markets are open all the time and don't close. AuthenticBot is a fully automated bot, that trades on your behalf 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. It was created by a couple of clever developers in Germany. They've been working on it for a year, and finally made it publicly available in Feb 2021.

AB uses a set of indicators to look for likely points of Bitcoin price reversals. It will determine trade bias, trade amount, entry point and exit point. It will then long/short BTC futures using small amounts and dollar cost average until the exit point is reached. The bot will never leverage more then 10% of your account, and most of the time only bets 1%.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT EXCHANGE DOES IT USE?

The bot uses the ByBit exchange that allows you to trade futures contracts on BTC. ByBit does NOT support all countries, and will filter out IP addresses coming those countries. For instance, the US is one of the handful of countries NOT supported, but most other countries (ex: Canada) are supported. Beyond an IP check, they don't check for anything else…**so some people will use VPNs to fund their bybit account.**

There's a lots of videos on what bybit is and how to trade on it, here are a couple:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/90d6vb7fvn871.png?width=633&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=047141e815bcbbab9944801c86040c0a65b22780

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2mbihq5gvn871.png?width=627&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e91543f3a258cc8bc9f9e637b2f330cbef8992fd

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

ARE MY FUNDS SAFE?

The first question is if the funds are safe from the bot owners? As an account owner, you would grant the bot API permissions to ONLY perform trades on your behalf. The bot would NOT have permissions to do withdrawals, only do trades.

The next question is are the funds safe on ByBit exchange? Any hot wallet is less safe then a cold wallet, and ByBit is likely no exception. ByBit is also not FDIC insured. So if you're accustomed to trading traditional securities on Etrade, this may not be for you. The bot needs access to your BTC to make trades with it, so having funds in a hot wallet is a risk if you want to trade BTC. There's lots of articles on ByBit exchange platform security, so I would recommend doing your own DD here. AB is definitely aimed for folks who are already trading crypto on exchanges like Coinbase, etc.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

SO…HOW HAS THE BOT PERFORMED?

When you setup the bot, they will create twitch stream where you can monitor your bots trades. The initial bot account ([https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44](https://www.twitch.tv/authenticbot44)) was created in Feb 2021 and seeded with 0.30393405 BTC ($10k USD at the time). As of today, it has 0.79744405 BTC ($26.2k USD)…for an increase of +162% BTC over 5 months!!

When I first looked at this, I thought it couldn't be true. So I looked at the trades since beginning of May 2021 when BTC was near 60k (it has crashed 40% in that time frame). Over that last 40 days, the bot has made 177 trades.

Keep in mind, 20% increase in BTC does NOT mean your account increased by 20% in USD. If BTC drops by an amount greater then 20% per month, a 20% increase in BTC likely means your account is close to break even. However if BTC can remain stable or increases, then your USD value will increase with the BTC growth.

As a day trader, I only make profits M-F. What I like about AuthenticBot is that it's trading for my 24/7. When I wake up, it's usually made a profit…sometimes small, sometimes big.

\- 165 trades were profitable (93%) vs 12 trades for losses (7%)

\- Average trade size was only 1.47% of the account

\- Average profit per trade was 0.00539 BTC (or $180 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average loss per trade was 0.0001183 (or $3.60 at $36k BTC/USD)

\- Average win:loss dollar ratio is almost 50:1.

\- **Average ROI over this 40d period was +0.69% BTC per day, or +20.7% per month (net of bot fees)**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW MUCH DO THEY CHARGE?

AB owners charge a fee based on monthly profits, so if you make BTC then they make BTC. They charge 30% of the profits they earned on your behalf. Yes it's a chunk, but you're not paying anything out of pocket. If they only earn a little, you pay a little. If they earn you a lot, then you pay more. **However, if you don't make any profits for the month, then they don't you charge anything and it's FREE.** So if they break even or lose BTC, then they worked for free for a month and you pay nothing. It's a shared risk model. They also have a minimum balance to start a new account. When they first started it was $10k USD, it's now $20k USD.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I LEARN MORE?

They have a website ([authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/)) but they primarily engage with users and interested folks via a discord server and operate mostly on word of mouth. If you're interested and are ok with the account minimum balance/fees, contact them via [authenticbot.com](https://authenticbot.com/) and they'll send you the discord link. You can join the discord server, ask questions and do your own due diligence. Again, costs absolutely nothing unless they make you a profit.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------

TLDR

\- Fully automated bot that trades on your behalf 24/7, created by some guys in Germany

\- Bot trades on bybit exchange, buying/selling BTC futures contracts leveraging up to 10% of account

\- Over past 40 day period, it has averaged 0.69% per day or 20.7% per month (net profit)

\- Initial bot account seeded with $10k USD (in February 2021) with no additional funding now at $27k USD

\- Bot charges 30% of net profit - so you're only charged if it makes you a profit, $20k USD account minimum"

1625165692,Bitcoin,"Tips for new crypto investors1. Ignore the “noise”

Many naysayers in the media and financial sectors may preach that cryptocurrency is simply a fad, over-hyped speculation, or even a pyramid scheme. On the other hand, a growing population increasingly embraces the financial prospects and practical applications of cryptocurrency assets. Both sides have loud voices and like to make a lot of noise.

This noise level is only expected to increase, as Satis Group predicted; To be a successful investor in this space, it is best to just buy and hold what you believe in (see tip 4!) while ignoring all the noise around you.

2. Expect the unexpected

However, significant volatility does exist in cryptocurrency markets which cannot be ignored. Experienced cryptocurrency investors are accustomed to huge price swings that you often don’t find in traditional markets. By mentally preparing for these unfavorable, and occasionally terrifying, investment performances, the intelligent crypto investor will be able to act rationally instead of emotionally in times of unexpected price drops.

3. Avoid a bad trade or investment strategy

A common mistake for beginner cryptocurrency investors is joining what is known as a “pump and dump group” Certain social media communities or ‘gurus’ may even promise investment tips regarding a particular coin. You should avoid these types of places at all costs; when travelers go down these roads, they don’t often come back.

The problem is that since derivatives trading is a zero-sum game, there is always a winner, but more importantly a loser. Unless a solid trading or investment strategy is in place, heedlessly following such advice is the fast track to losing your money to modern-day snake oil salesmen.

4. Perform your due diligence

In this modern digital age, there is even wifi on the path to crypto investing enlightenment, hence there is no excuse to make an investment with little to no understanding of the underlying asset. Almost every single coin has easily accessible whitepapers online. And just like having maps in the car, the savvy traveler must be prepared.

From the heavily traded to the most niche, resources such as the All Crypto Whitepapers will help any individual brush up their knowledge on potential future investments. If it is impossible to tell how the coin operates and more importantly, makes money, then it would be wise to seek another investment opportunity. From the biggest initial coin offerings (ICOs) to the most niche altcoins, this site will have you covered.

5. Don’t place all your crypto-coins in one basket

Common investment wisdom prevails when it comes to cryptocurrency investment: diversification is key. Just as financial advisors recommend taking positions in multiple types of stocks and other investments, diversification is also essential for any healthy cryptocurrency portfolio.

You’ve done your research, so now seize the opportunity to invest in multiple coins. As one example, you can invest across different sectors which serve different use cases. Just like it’s always safer to travel as a group then as a single person when you’re in unfamiliar territory, establishing a diversified portfolio will help you along your path toward realizing potential future cryptocurrency gains.

6. Opt for an alternative personal email

Using a regular email account places an investor at an unnecessary risk of exposure for a data breach. To overcome this risk, it is recommended to create a unique account just for trading, especially with added two-factor authentication password security. No matter what, ensure that two-factor authentication is utilized for every service that offers it (for example both your email account and your exchange account should require two-factor authorization to access). Likewise, make sure to use a dedicated two-factor application (such as Google authenticator, or Authy) as opposed to using text messages for two-factor authorization (these are susceptible to social engineering hacks).

Additionally, when setting up your accounts, be sure to select a unique username and password that has no personally identifiable information that would-be hackers could trace back to you.

7. Understand the uses for both cold and hot wallets

Cryptocurrency can be stored via an offline “cold” wallet or an online “hot” wallet. Ease of access makes hot wallets a more desirable option for the beginner investor. However, as convenient as hot wallets are, they are susceptible to being hacked, whereas cold wallets are not able to be hacked (if prepared properly). Ideally, it’s best to store cryptocurrency you plan on saving for a long time in a cold wallet, and keep only a small amount that you might use on a daily basis in a hot wallet.

Additionally, one common mistake made by many new investors is mistaking exchanges for wallets. Although it might seem convenient keeping everything online at an exchange, a common mantra you might hear others chanting goes like ‘if you don’t own your keys, then you don’t own your bitcoin’. And when you keep your digital assets on exchanges, you don’t own the keys. This can become important when exchanges go down, get hacked. Take the time to research different wallet providers. There are lots of great options available today.

8. Remain careful around mobile wallets

Trading or storing large sums of any cryptocurrency via mobile phone is simply too great a risk. Mobile phones are more prone to being compromised electronically or physically. Although convenient, convenience should not surpass the security concerns that abound with executing trades or storing assets on mobile devices.

Hopefully, these eight tips will help give you solid footing on the road toward crypto-investing. Looking for more tips."

2nd Take: In last 10 years, Whenever June close with red candle , July gave jump of of 18%-24%. So if July 2021 follow same , we will see target of near $42k as per average 20% growth.

3rd Take: In 2021,month jump is opposite of last 10 years trend. Examples are:
-Out of 10 times, March give 2 green and 8 red months in last 10 years. But in 2021 March gave 30% jump that was opposite of Trend.

1625161324,Bitcoin,"Regarding Yesterday's Congressional Hearing with Coincenter's TestimonyI feel like the single missing part of regulatory talk in the united states on crypto is that no one understands that a unified clearing exchange for digital asset commodities will have to be built and the Token taxonomy act, and Digital Commodity act passed. 

&amp;#x200B;

CME can't work with blockchain. LedgerX and coinbase built the full financial stack. Traditional finance does not do this. Trad fi uses common clearing exchanges, prime brokers etc. It's economically unfeasible and untenable to expect every crypto service to build a full stack.  

&amp;#x200B;

 The obsession crypto people have with the SEC is misplaced. Bitcoin is a commodity. There has to be common backends that allow systemic risk monitoring and public data. That's how tradfi works, and US gov won't allow any other way. This is nonnegotiable for having a domestic market that institutions use. Right now all major institutions do significant derivative related things offshore. 

&amp;#x200B;

This can't and wont last based on what the DoJ wants. You may not like the direction things are going, but this is necessary to mainstream adoption. Crypto is overwhelmed with fraud as it is. It's a net detriment to long term adoption.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Re the mods-- You should not censor traders and legal researchers because you disagree with the government and hate futures. 

The mods here need to realize that being adversarial to regulatory talk is a zero sum affair. If you don't advocate for changes that allow modern institutions to participate we will not get mainstream hyperbitcoinization.  Shadow banks and hedgefunds trading on bitmex does not count, it \*is\* the problem. ***It's why congress is pissed.***

He wants to create a permanent resistance movement using blockchain to fix everything from file sharing to social media and banks. But thats futile. 

Blockchain only needs to be used in a small manner and with great precicion, namely to establish sound money. Because with sound money statism cannot exist and cause the problems it does today. I know it looks like facebook, banks, spotify etc. seem like culprits, but they are responding to incentives. Regulations are shaping their business models and reducing competition.

So instead of forming a permanent resistance movement by using blockchain for everything, just use it in such a way that the source of regulations is eleminated. Then we will have freedom, and then the world can begin to heal. Have a nice day."

I get that less BTC in circulation theoretically makes the remaining BTC more valuable.  But at some point might it erode to the point that there is so little left it would become too rare to become a meaningful currency/store of value.  At some point (if it isn't happening already) there will be more BTC lost than is mined every day.  At that point the math dictates that the supply of BTC will forever trend toward zero.

If BTC becomes adopted by billions of people, that's a lot of opportunity for private keys to be lost/forgotten/taken to the grave every day.

It seems like at some point it would become a problem that has to be addressed.

1625264591,Bitcoin,"Brainstorming: Can Proof-of Stake based coins be more attractive to big states that want to keep control?Disclaimer: I am Bitcoin-Only, anything but Bitcoin is garbage to me. This post is just a discussions on a recent thought I had when assessing potential risks for future Bitcoin adoption. I am a very recent Bitcoiner so it is very possible that I'm making a basic logic mistake. Feel free to point that out.

As stated above, I only hold Bitcoin and I am constantly assessing the risks of Bitcoin failing or the Bitcoin adoption not going as I expect in the next 10 years.

As any Bitcoiner I don't believe any other cryptocurrency has any value because they trade-off fundamental values that only Bitcoin has been able to bring to the table (truly decentralised, censorship resistant, proof-of work, etc.). However, I am trying to assess the possibility of a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency seeing wider adotption or at least endorsement from big states (US, EU countries, etc), and here is my rationale:

**If Proof-of-Stake is worse at ensuring decentralisation because whoever has the biggest stakes has the biggest power, wouldn't that be attractive for governments who want to keep at leats a certain level of control on the circulating currencies?** For instance, If the US was to use adopt one cryptocurrency as a reserve asset, would they be more attracted to one that they could more easily control (like Ethereum 2.0)?

I am assuming that everything else works properly in Ethereum 2.0 in this case (both technically and economically), which is far from obvious and granted.

Website was 17year.com but it has since been unregistered. The site had a 23 person queue, which seemed odd for such an old site. I also couldn't find any details on who had registered it or when. I had picked a random address before the shut down: (1EFUPp9gf1kWevhVKvchEdAXk3YQiBtnub, if you're brave enough to mess with it), and sent about 100 quid, 0.0041 Bitcoin, to the address. After about 12 hours, I get an email from an unrecognized address to my main email (not the email associated with my bitcoin address) saying the following:

Dear Mr. M2BT\_1328,

Thank you for your donation to our organization, and your support for our international pursuits is duly noted. We will use these funds to continue our cryptographic activities to bring online privacy to all.

\-17 Year Project.

It had this PGP ID: 7A35090F. What group is this? I know that the chances are low that this is real, and that it could be any old person on the internet trying to troll me, but how did they get my main email address, that I have not associated with any of my subscriptions, least of all bitcoin.

I did some further digging, and found this is a freewallet.io address. Clearly the account holder did not want to give any information to a registered company, so they opted for the opensource alternative. Can anyone do more checks and digging? I really want to know what's going on, and if this is a hoax. If I didn't make a mistake, the PGP is the same as Cicada 3301, and the signature at the end of the email supports that. I have read that in the US, Cicadas swarm every 17 years. Honestly that's as far as I can get since I work as a builder and am not tech savvy . Even most of this digging was done by my friend in Edinburgh, I'm just posting it. That is all."

If I want to follow the ""not your keys; not your coins""-style I would have to essentially run a node myself, because of the way the system with channels and so on is set up, right?

Do you see any way this could change in the future where you could allow for essentially trustless-SPV wallets without this requirement?

Breeze e.g. is non-custodial, but it works by essentially running a node on your phone?  
Now this would be good option, if the wallet itself wouldn't charge you fees on top of it?  
Phoenix is another wallet, but also charges you fees to use it (and requries a huge 10k sat inital deposit?).  
It's similar for muun IIRC.

Wallet of satoshi is of course custodial, but since it doesn't charge you fees it actually seems like the best option for a mobile wallet right now?

But then there are also transaction fees that senders have to pay to minders. At the moment, average transaction fee is USD 10.61 ([https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin\_average\_transaction\_fee](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee)). Also, at present, each block contains an average of 2,420 transactions. In total, the fees paid by all senders inside the block would be USD 10.61 x 2,420 =USD 25,676.2

So the total comp that a miner (or mining pool) who successfully ads a new block would be: USD 207,500 + USD 25,676.2 = **USD 233,176.2**

1625251472,Bitcoin,"Awesome method to secure your seed phrase.Hi folks. We know in crypto world, private key gives anyone the full authority to use the funds. So securing your seed phrase is of utmost importance. Here i suggest a very clean and a secure method to store your seed phrase(which in turn generates your private keys).

1. We need a MacOS computer. Open the Keychain Access program(it is buid-in app on every mac).
2. Click the File menu and choose NEW KEYCHAIN to create a new keychain(it is a file basically). Give it name which will make this file easily recognisable to use even after many years(eg- important file OR bitcoin wallet seed phrase keychain). Create a very very strong password for it consisting of numbers alphabets &amp; special characters.
3. On the upper left corner of the Keychain Access program, you will see your newly created Keychain added to the list of default existing kekychains. Select the newly created keychain. Then go to File menu and choose NEW SECURE NOTE. This will create a secure note item inside this keychain. Give the note a suitable name(eg- my first bitcoin wallet details ETC).
4. Write down the seed phrase in this note. So now, your seed phrase sits in a secure note, which intern in sitting inside a special keychain file which a very strong password.
5. Now, from your Finder, reach your newly created keychain file(it will a .keychain file) and transfer it to a usb drive. Once you have the keychain file on a usb drive, enter the keychain access app and right click your keychain file(in the right upper corner of the app) and select DELETE FILE AND THE REFERENCE. This will delete that keychain file from your mac and it will also dissappear from the keychain access app. So if someone gets to your mac, opens keychain access, he will see only your default keychains. Problem of storing seed phrase in a secure note in the default keychains is that the password for it is the same as your macs logins password(which is mostly a simple password for daily use ease purpose).
6. The vey strong password that you created in step 4, you save it in a secure note in your default keychain. 
7. So if thief gets to your mac, reaches your keychain access and gets your very secure password, he will not get the secure keychain file(which you will be storing in a secure place away from your mac). You can make multiple copies of the secure keychain file and store it in multiple usb drives and store them at multiple places. As no one can open the file without the very secure password, just getting the file will not be useful for the thief. 
8. On a later date, if you feel that your very secure password is compromised somehow, you can open your secure keychain file from the usb drive in other secure imac and change its password.
9. This way, using the keychain access app of macos, we can secure our seed phrase.
10. Please leave your comment if you feel this helpful OR if you find any flaws in this method. Thank you."

* will never have its value inflated away

​

Meanwhile, it slowly dawns on the rest of humanity that ""central banking"" and its fiat ""play money"" currencies is the biggest scam of all time. Slowly.

1625348204,Bitcoin,"Concerns about privacy. Can we have a little discussion?Recently, i have been thinking about privacy and Bitcoin.

I know that Bitcoin is pseudonymous, as you can track every adress. It is somehow private in a way that nobody know who own which adress. Atleast until you glue your name to some of them.

If you buy through KYC service with fiat like coinbase or Binance, they have this one line that says ""date, amount, name, verification of ID, adress where it went"" and from this time they can track everything you did with your money.

Arent you afraid of your government? Until US passed executive order on gold confiscation, nobody thought that could happen.

Dont you think that they can do the same with bitcoin? They know everything they need and even if you dont have it anymore, you have mark on your skin... only way how to prevent them is buying though non-kyc or old P2P with cash.

There are other reasons. Tracking, social problems because they can prove you re ""dirty energy waster and you are probably molesting kids"", there might be persecutions and basically have to obey every law of taxation and persecution, because they KNOW you boght coin.

Arent you concerned about some of those scenarios? 

They might seem like the worst one, but every day we are losing our rights and this is not different. It might be much faster in future, if governments see their power vanishing with fiat currencies value and trust. 

What can i do to prevent that except buying bitcoins P2P with services like Bisq or face-to-face?"

Buy a mining device, the more hash rate the more money you'll gonna make. Remember, you won't need any fans, just a good passive heat radiator, bigger surface is better.

Build a satellite and mount your mining device on that baby. In case of power, just stick a nuclear battery on it.

3. Step:

Launch that satellite into the space and let it fly with the highest possible speed into the Orbit of an black hole. 


Now you're done. You have the worldwide fastest minding machine! Because of the rising speed of your satellite, wich is slowly getting sucked into the black hole while it's spinning on the Orbit, relatively the time will slow down for that satellite.

Bitcoin had a solid start to 2021, hitting an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April. But the digital coin closed out the first half of the year down about 47% from its record — and a number of looming risks could result in further pain ahead.
While proponents appear to be holding onto bitcoin for now, other investors are wary about wild volatility in the market and what it means for their portfolios. With that in mind, here are five of the biggest risks facing the cryptocurrency as we enter the second half of the year.
Regulation
One of the biggest risks for bitcoin right now is regulation.

In recent weeks, China has clamped down on its cryptocurrency industry, shuttering energy-intensive crypto mining operations and ordering major banks and payment firms like Alipay not to do business with crypto companies.

Last week, the global crypto crackdown spread to the U.K., where regulators banned leading digital currency exchange Binance from undertaking regulated activities.

Simon Yu, co-founder and CEO of crypto cashback start-up StormX, told CNBC that China’s moves should be viewed as a “positive” thing for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies like ether as it will lead to more decentralization. However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

However, he added that “over-regulation” of crypto in the United States could be a problem.

“As a country, the U.S. has too many departments regulating it from different angles — is crypto a security? A commodity? A property?” Yu said. “As of now, the U.S. hasn’t figured out how to properly regulate the industry, which oftentimes leads to decisions that are difficult for crypto to operate.”

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials have recently warned about the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit transactions.

Last year, former President Donald Trump’s administration proposed an anti-money laundering rule that would require people who hold their crypto in a private digital wallet to undergo identity checks if they make transactions of $3,000 or more.
“We’ve long warned that shifting investor sentiment or regulatory crackdowns could pop bubble-like crypto markets,” UBS wrote in a note this week.

Volatility
Another big risk is persistent, extreme swings in the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Bitcoin rallied to an all-time record of around $64,829 in April this year, on the day of crypto exchange Coinbase’s blockbuster debut. It then tumbled as low as $28,911 in June, briefly sliding below $30,000 and turning negative for the year. It’s since risen back above $34,000.
Bitcoin bulls see it as a kind of “digital gold” — an asset uncorrelated to the wider marker that could provide sizable returns in times of economic turbulence. But while volatility can be good when the price of an asset is going up, it goes both ways.

While you would have doubled your money if you bought bitcoin in January and cashed out in April, today those year-to-date returns would be 18%. Still, that’s above the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index, which is up 16% since the start of the year. And over the last 12 months, bitcoin has more than tripled in price.
“Limited, highly inelastic supply on single cryptos can exacerbate volatility,” says UBS. “Limited real world use and extraordinary price volatility also indicate many buyers are seeking speculative gains.”

Meanwhile, the trend of traders who have made highly-leveraged bets on bitcoin getting flushed out of the market has led to intense price fluctuations this year.

While continuous volatility could put off some investors, Ross Middleton, chief financial officer of decentralized finance platform DeversiFi, said that volatility in itself isn’t a barrier to institutional adoption.
Volatility “can actually be a significant draw as the potential for large price movements means that funds can make significant profits with a relatively small allocation compared to the size of their overall portfolio,” he told CNBC.

“The longer that Bitcoin moves sidewards in the $30-$40k range,” Middleton added, “the greater the perceived ‘base-building’ and the sooner that new capital will flow into both the asset and the wider crypto market.”
Environmental concerns
Questions surrounding bitcoin’s impact on the environment could be another big headwind for the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin mining equipment requires lots of electricity to run, and bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen considerably over the years in tandem with its price.

While bitcoin’s critics have long warned of its huge carbon footprint, Tesla CEO Elon Musk brought the issue back to the fore this year."
1625339764,Bitcoin,"Bitcoin mining is now easier and more profitable as algorithm adjusts after China crackdownMore than 54% of bitcoin’s hashrate, which is the collective computing power of miners worldwide, has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
The bitcoin code has re-calibrated to make it 28% less difficult to mine.
Miners who are still plugged into the network stand to make greater profits while most of the network’s miners remains offline.
It just became a whole lot easier and much more profitable to mine for bitcoin.

The world has known for months that more than half the world’s bitcoin miners would be going dark as China cracked down on mining. Now that it’s happened, the bitcoin algorithm has adjusted accordingly to make sure miner productivity doesn’t continue to fall off a cliff. 

That adjustment – which took effect early Saturday morning – also means that way more cash is going to the bitcoin miners who remain online.

“This will be a revenue party for miners,” said bitcoin mining engineer Brandon Arvanaghi.

“They suddenly own a meaningfully larger piece of the pie, meaning they earn more bitcoin every day.”
Mining made easier
A bitcoin miner runs a program on a computer to try to solve a puzzle before anyone else does. Solving that puzzle is what completes a block, a process that both creates new bitcoin and updates the digital ledger keeping track of all bitcoin transactions. 

China had long been the epicenter of bitcoin miners, with past estimates indicating that 65% to 75% of the world’s bitcoin mining happened there, but a government-led crackdown has effectively banished the country’s crypto miners. 

″For the first time in the bitcoin network’s history, we have a complete shutdown of mining in a targeted geographic region that affected more than 50% of the network,” said Darin Feinstein, founder of Blockcap and Core Scientific. 
More than 50% of the hashrate – the collective computing power of miners worldwide – has dropped off the network since its market peak in May.
Fewer people mining means that fewer blocks are solved each day. Typically, it takes about 10 minutes to complete a block, but Feinstein told CNBC the bitcoin network has slowed down to 14- to 19-minute block times.

This is precisely why bitcoin re-calibrates every 2016 blocks, or about every two weeks, resetting how tough it is for miners to mine. On Saturday, the bitcoin code automatically made it about 28% less difficult to mine – a historically unprecedented drop for the network – thereby restoring block times back to the optimal 10-minute window. 
The bitcoin algorithm is programmed to handle an increase or decrease in mining machines, according to Mike Colyer, CEO of digital currency company Foundry. “It is a self-regulating market that does not require any outside committee to determine what to do. This is a very powerful concept,” he said.
Fewer competitors and less difficulty means that any miner with a machine plugged in is going to see a significant increase in profitability and more predictable revenue.

“All bitcoin miners share in the same economics and are mining on the same network, so miners both public and private will see the uplift in revenue,” said Kevin Zhang, former Chief Mining Officer at Greenridge Generation, the first major U.S. power plant to begin mining behind-the-meter at a large scale. 

Assuming fixed power costs, Zhang estimates revenues of $29 per day for those using the latest-generation Bitmain miner, versus $22 per day prior to the change. Longer-term, although miner income can fluctuate with the price of the coin, Zhang also noted that mining revenues have dropped only 17% from the bitcoin price peak in April, whereas the coin’s price has dropped about 50%.
“We are expecting a period of much higher mining profitability for Compass Mining clients,” said Whit Gibbs, CEO and founder of Compass, a bitcoin mining service provider. “We expect miners to be approximately 35% more profitable.”

Blockcap’s Feinstein agrees. “We are expecting a revenue and profit increase for the foreseeable future.  This was an unexpected gift to the network, not just on revenues but on decentralization and sustainable energy metrics.”

Although the difficulty drop benefits all miners, those using new-generation equipment stand to benefit the most.

Feinstein tells CNBC that most of the gear in China that was turned off was old-generation equipment, which is inefficient and runs on much smaller profit margins.  
Six-month surge
It is hard to predict how long the hashrate deficit will last. Barbour said that it is totally possible that Beijing could simply reverse their policy, and this could only be a short-term interruption. 

If not, most mining crypto experts agree that it will take anywhere from six to 15 months for all of that idle and displaced mining hardware to migrate. “It’s going to take a long time for the surplus to find a home,” said Barbour. 

Gibbs thinks miners should see heightened revenue for at least the rest of 2021.

“Every day the Chinese miners are searching globally for places to turn their machines back on. There is very limited space at the moment,” said Colyer.
Part of the problem, according to Feinstein, is that even before China cut off mining, there was already a lack of infrastructure to house the new-generation miners being deployed monthly by Beijing-based manufacturer Bitmain.

Now that the market is flooded with an over-supply of used mining rigs, it is tough to say how fast countries will be able to absorb the influx of gear. 

“Some mining companies have had everything built and were just waiting for these ASICs to plug in, which would only take a couple days,” explained Arvanaghi.

“Others may need to build containers, extend warehouses, or increase their power capacity. We won’t see the hashrate reach what it used to be overnight, but we’ll see it tick back up over the next few months,” he continued.
Of all the possible destinations for this equipment, the U.S. appears to be especially well-positioned to absorb this stray hashrate. CNBC is told that major U.S. mining operators are already signing deals to patriate some of these homeless Bitmain miners. 

U.S. bitcoin mining is booming, and has venture capital flowing to it, so they are poised to take advantage of the miner migration, Arvanaghi told CNBC. 

“Many U.S. bitcoin miners that were funded when bitcoin’s price started rising in November and December of 2020 means that they were already building out their power capacity when the China mining ban took hold,” he said. “It’s great timing.”

But Barbour believes that much smaller players in the residential U.S. also stand a chance at capturing these excess miners. 

“I think this is a signal that in the future, bitcoin mining will be more distributed by necessity,” said Barbour. “Less mega-mines like the 100+ megawatt ones we see in Texas and more small mines on small commercial and eventually residential spaces. It’s much harder for a politician to shut down a mine in someone’s garage.”"
1625339500,Bitcoin,"Here’s what cryptocurrencies will look like in 50 years according to expertsWe may not know what stocks in the S&amp;P 500 will do next month, or in two years, but over the decades, we have a pretty good hunch that they’ll go up. Most of us also know what a stock is, and that definition hasn’t changed in centuries.

None of that is true, of course, with cryptocurrencies. Some predict the coins will forever change how we understand and interact with money and others warn of a dangerous bubble.

But whatever a person forecasts for cryptocurrencies, it’s getting harder to imagine a future without them.
CNBC asked experts from a variety of fields to describe their vision for the currencies 50 years from now. Their answers have been condensed and edited for clarity.

• Ivory Johnson, certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management

“Cryptocurrencies will disrupt traditional finance because one of their most attractive utilities is the ability to efficiently transfer payment across borders with little to no cost, delay or foreign currency fluctuations. With respect to bitcoin, 50 years is a long time and bitcoin could either become the world reserve currency or the next AOL that made a lot of people wealthy until it was unseated by better technology.”
“Way before 2071, the dollar will have more in common with a crypto than with silver or gold, so there is no need to doubt the longevity of encrypted algorithms as stores of value and media of exchange. All money is a form of encryption. It’s been that way from the start, and as our lives converge ever more closely with the digital universe, the drive to invest in tokens will only accelerate. Ironically, that impulse will connect us to primitive instincts, and do its part to keep us human.”
“Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have proven themselves useful for money movement and speculation, and they’re unlikely to go away. But where and how we’ll generate the energy to meet the demand of a growing crypto market is worth considering, as well as whether state-actors who view it as a competitor to fiat power will make it even more of a black-market commodity.”
 Dragan Boscovic, founder and director of the Blockchain Research Lab at Arizona State University

“Central bank authorities are busy developing regulations on cryptocurrency. They recognize that digital currencies are native to the digital economy and, as such, are on their way to becoming mainstream in the next 10 years.”"

1625338593,Bitcoin,"Trouble understanding how a custom Signet works in Bitcoincore.Hello, I have set up a custom Signet node, with my own challenge. 

I thought that to issue a correct block for Signet, I would need to sign it with the proper miner and that would not be possible to use the \`generatetoaddress\` API for issuing blocks as I would do in regtest.

  
I was wrong, at least with bitcoincore 0.21.1, and I don't get why I can still emit valid blocks with just the Proof Of Work.

Could anyone kindly take a sec to explain why this API still works, or point me to the codebase consensus part for Signet, maybe?

Thank you very much."

1625338417,Bitcoin,"Great way to DCA on KrakenHey there,

i am pretty new to the space, but dove into the rabbithole failry quickly. I was searching for a secure and cheap way to DCA. In Germany there aren't many exchanges offering a savings plan, apart from Bitpanda, Relai, PocketBitcoin, GetBittr. The fees are unacceptable on all of them and the latter three are located in Switzerland which is annoying because i have to send EUR to CHF.

Then i stumbled over this Docker Image: 

[https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca](https://github.com/Jorijn/bitcoin-dca)

Via the Kraken API and this Guys docker container you can execute commands, like:

* buy btc with funds on your kraken account
* withdraw to a specified btc address
* get balance

By setting cronjobs you can specify the intervals at which btc is bought or withdrawn to cold storage.

For firther info, see the Git repo."
